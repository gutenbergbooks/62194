<h3 class="nobreak">I &nbsp; Lavinia</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Tense quiet filled the crooked streets of Bromfield,
the quiet that presages storm. Vine Larimore looked
anxiously from the window. She was not afraid of tempests:
she reveled in them. But a great fear had gripped
her in the night. Why had Calvin failed to stop on
his way home from the station? What business was
it that took Calvin Stone to Rochester every week or
two? Another sweetheart? She would not give the
hideous thought house room. Was not she, Lavinia
Larimore, the handsomest girl in Bromfield? Was not
her father, next to the Calvins and the Stones, the most
important man in the rusty old New York village?
Had she not worn Calvin&#8217;s ring for three endless years?
Most of the girls in her set were already married, and
at New Year&#8217;s she had worn the green stockings for her
seventeen-year-old sister, Isabel. The wedding dress
she had made with so much care and skill, two years
agone, hid its once modish lines beneath the cover of the
cedar chest&mdash;the hope chest that Calvin had ordered
for her at Stephen Trench&#8217;s shop.</p>

<p>Calvin&#8217;s father had promised them the old house on
High Street, to be remodeled and furnished with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
best that Rochester could provide. Mr. Trench had
twice figured on the contract, and yet Calvin dallied.
It was first one pretext and then another. Once, when
he asked her what she wanted for her birthday&mdash;it was
the latter part of May, and Lavinia would be twenty&mdash;she
took her courage in her shaking hands and pleaded
for a wedding. It was an unmaidenly thing. Bromfield
would have branded her as bold. But Calvin saw in her
abashed eyes the image of his own dereliction. To be
sure he still loved her. He had always intended to make
good his pledge. They would be married the middle
of August, when the G. A. R. was giving a great excursion
to New York City. That would be a honeymoon
well worth the waiting.</p>

<p>And then, on the second of July, the President was
shot. Vine was shocked, as everyone was; but what
had that to do with her wedding? Calvin could not
think of marrying while Mr. Garfield&#8217;s life was in doubt.</p>

<p>The President had died, and it was now October.
Vine saw Calvin almost daily. In a little town, with the
Larimore home near the middle of the principal street,
such contact was almost inevitable. But Lavinia found
no avenue of approach. Calvin was usually sullen or
distraught. Sometimes he took the long détour across
the bridge and up behind Stephen Trench&#8217;s carpenter
shop, on his way to and from the bank. This morning,
with a storm brewing, he could hardly risk that walk.
He must pass the house any minute. She would stop
him and demand an explanation. She knew just what
she wanted to say, and when she was thoroughly aroused
her tongue never failed her.</p>

<p>There was a step on the grass-grown flag-stones, an
eager step. Lavinia was on her feet&mdash;her fury gone,
she knew not where, or why. He was coming. In another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
minute she would be in his arms, listening to the
same old excuses, feeding her hope on the same old
shreds of promise. And then.... The front door
opened and Ellen Porter&#8217;s interrogating eyes met hers.
Ellen and Ted Larimore were soon to be married, but
the early morning call had nothing to do with the fever
of activity that had disturbed the routine of two households
for a month past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vine, did Calvin show you what he bought in Rochester
yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you he bought anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa. He saw him in the jewelry store. He was
looking at wedding rings. He turned his back when
he saw somebody from Bromfield; but papa was almost
sure he bought one. Viny, are you going to beat Ted
and me out, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia thought for a moment that she would suffocate.
The blood pounded in her ears and the room
swam dizzily before her. And then the storm broke.
She tried to fashion some convincing reply; but the thunder
was deafening and the rain beat loudly against the
windows. She ran to get a floor cloth, when little rivulets
began to trickle over the sill. Ellen sought to
help her with the transom, that was seldom closed from
spring to fall, when the door was pushed open violently
and Ted Larimore, dripping and out of temper, burst
into the room. He had forgotten something. No, he
could not stop to change his coat. He would take Ellen
back to the store with him. For this, at least, his sister
was grateful. By noon she would have seen Calvin&mdash;would
know the meaning of the ring. She would see
Calvin ... if she had to go to the bank. Things could
not go on this way.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II &nbsp; Calvin</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>While Ted and Ellen strolled down Main Street,
oblivious of the rain that swirled upon them, now from
the east, now from the south, and while Lavinia plunged
with headlong haste into the morning&#8217;s housework, a
conversation was under way in the dining-room of the
Stone mansion. Calvin was late coming down to breakfast
and his father had waited for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have something on your mind, and you might as
well out with it,&#8221; the elder was saying, as he drew his
napkin from his collar and folded it crookedly.</p>

<p>Calvin drummed the table with uneasy fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gambling again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then? Look here, Calvin Stone, you can&#8217;t
fool your mother and me. You act like a sheep-stealing
dog. What were you doing in Rochester yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was married.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words fell with the dull impact of a mass of putty.
His father&#8217;s eyes opened wide, then narrowed, and his
huge shoulders bent forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did you marry? Vine wasn&#8217;t with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just the trouble, father. I didn&#8217;t marry Vine.
Fact is, I didn&#8217;t intend to get married at all. Lettie
took me by surprise when she told me&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8220;Lettie who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arlette Fournier. She&#8217;s French&mdash;and a stunner. I
met her at a dance last winter. Oh, she&#8217;s a good fellow.
She&#8217;ll keep it secret till I get out of this scrape with Vine.
She wouldn&#8217;t want me to bring her to Bromfield for a
year or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stone brought his fist down on the table with a
vehemence that rattled the breakfast china.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no conscience, no decency? How are you
going to square yourself with that girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t square myself with both of them. I&#8217;ve
been thinking it over, since I got home last night. I
thought I&#8217;d play on Vine&#8217;s pride ... snub her openly,
you know, so that she&#8217;d get in a huff and throw me over.
Then I could afterwards pretend I married the other
girl for spite. That would save Vine&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort, you miserable coward.
You are going to Viny Larimore this very morning, and
confess what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I am not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. I&#8217;d
never get out of her house alive. You never saw Vine
when she was mad. I&#8217;d go back to Rochester&mdash;I&#8217;d&mdash;jump
in the river, before I&#8217;d face her. I don&#8217;t have to
stay here. Lettie has money of her own, that we could
live off of. She doesn&#8217;t want to live in this ugly village,
any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could take your living from this stranger, this
foreigner that nobody ever heard of? You&mdash;you say
she is rich? Who are her people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, won&#8217;t you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Calvin&#8217;s voice, a moment before raucous with assurance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and determination, broke into waves of impotent
pleading. He had perceived the flaw in his parent&#8217;s
armour. To press home his advantage was the task of
the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her uncle is one of the leading business men of
Rochester, and she has money in her own right. She&#8217;s
been an orphan since she was six years old&mdash;sent over
here from France by herself, after her parents died,
and nobody to look after her. Father, won&#8217;t you go
and straighten it out with Vine? Honest, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The elder Stone spat with disgust.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>In slicker and high rubber boots Calvin took the long
muddy road to the bank. From every rain-drenched
shrub along the way Lavinia Larimore&#8217;s outraged womanhood
glared at him. For an hour he tried to work,
conscious of his father&#8217;s eyes with their unfeeling condemnation.
When the strain became unbearable, he took
a silver-mounted pistol from the safe&mdash;with surreptitious
gesture, yet making sure that the object in his hand did
not escape notice&mdash;and thrust it into the drawer of his
desk. The threat bore fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Stone took down hat and umbrella and went forth
into the abating storm. He was not a man to mince
words when he had an unpleasant task before him. Vine
greeted him at the door. Her dark cheeks blanched.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;where is Calvin? Is he sick? Has anything
happened to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to God he was dead. Viny, I hope you don&#8217;t
care any too much for that young scoundrel. He isn&#8217;t
worthy of the love of a decent girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t&mdash; You mean, he has embezzled money?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Mr. Stone, you won&#8217;t let it be found out? I wouldn&#8217;t
go back on him for&mdash;Oh, you won&#8217;t....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d brain him if he ever touched a penny that didn&#8217;t
belong to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&mdash;what has he done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was married, yesterday, to a girl in Rochester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Married!&#8221; And then, in an incredulous whisper,
&#8220;married.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment only Lavinia stood numb and baffled.
Then the words poured in a rising tide of indignation,
rage, fury. Three years she had waited, and for this.
She might have had any one of a dozen&mdash;the finest
young men in Bromfield. Calvin Stone had won her
away from them all. He had deprived her of her girlhood,
her opportunities&mdash;everything but her self-respect.
She had known for two years that he was a drunkard
and a gambler. She had clung to him, because it was
her Christian duty to reform him. His parents would
not have her to blame when he reeled into a drunkard&#8217;s
grave. It was fortunate that some fool woman had
taken the burden from her shoulders. She would have
stuck to her promise, in the face of certain misery. The
Larimores had that kind of honour&mdash;such honour as all
the Calvin and Stone money could not buy. But now she
need no longer keep up the pretense of caring for a man
who was not fit to wipe the mud from her shoes. She
had tried to hold together what little manhood was in
him&mdash;to spare his parents the disgrace he was sure to
bring upon them.</p>

<p>Once and again the bank president, who was wont to
command silence, to be granted a respectful hearing in
the highest councils of the town, sought to breast the tide
of her anger. His interruptions were swept away like
spindrift. He wanted to offer financial restitution, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
no other was possible. She met the proposal with scorn.
Money could not cover up the disgrace of such a consummation.
Calvin might rue his bargain, and come back
to plead for forgiveness. The desperately proffered
balm brought a more bitter outburst. She would not be
any man&#8217;s second choice. No, the damage was irreparable.
It was done.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>As the man of finance turned the interview over in his
mind, a curious balance was struck&mdash;and his heart
softened towards his son. There might have been
other tongue-lashings. No woman could have achieved
such fluency without practice. Before he reached the
front door of the little bank, Lavinia was in her own
room, her compact figure half submerged in the feather
bed, her hot tears of shame and chagrin wetting the
scarlet stars of the quilt her own deft fingers had pieced.
She had lost her temper&mdash;it was easily misplaced&mdash;but
the scene she had raised had no share in her memory of
the encounter. Her humiliation blotted all else from
view. It was not only that she had aimed at the highest,
and lost. She loved Calvin Stone with all the passion
of a fiery nature&mdash;loved him with a depth and intensity
that might be gauged by the hate that loomed on the
surface of her wrath. And there was no one in the
whole world to whom she could open her heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Larimore knew there had been a quarrel, a quarrel
that outran the morning&#8217;s tempest in violence; but
when she ventured to ask what the trouble was, Lavinia
told her curtly that it was none of her business. Now
she stood outside the door, listening to her daughter&#8217;s
stormy sobbing. She had never been on intimate terms
with her children, and the relationship with her eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
daughter was most casual. A headstrong girl. Where
she got her ambition&mdash;unless it was a heritage from her
Grandmother Larimore&mdash;no one could say. The other
members of the family were easygoing, content with the
day&#8217;s pleasure and profit. But Lavinia was avid for
work, for praise, for position. She would shine as Mrs.
Calvin Stone, if ever.... And then Mrs. Larimore
began afresh to wonder.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">III &nbsp; David</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Early in the afternoon, when the sun was making
furtive efforts to slip past the cloud-guard and repair
the damage the rain had wrought, Lavinia stepped
briskly from her room, clad in her best blue silk poplin.
An hour past she had been bathing her eyes, and her
mirror satisfied her that the redness and swelling were
all gone. She went straight to her father&#8217;s store, across
from the bank. Ellen Porter would be there, behind the
bookkeeper&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to do something for me, Nell,&#8221; she began&mdash;noting
the hollow in her voice, and striving against it.
&#8220;I want you to take this to Mr. Stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held a small, neatly tied parcel in her hand.
They walked to the wide doorway and stood watching
the sun-glints in the pools of the muddy street, each
waiting for the other to venture on some hospitable
avenue of speech. Ellen considered her thin-soled shoes,
scarce dry from the morning&#8217;s wetting, glanced at the
precarious stepping stones, half a block away ... and
caught sight of David Trench, coming towards them.
She beckoned him.</p>

<p>David was a shy, fair-cheeked youth, a few months
older than Lavinia and Ellen. The three had been
christened the same Sunday in the little Presbyterian
church. They had gone through the village school together,
and David and Ellen sang leading parts in the
church choir. It was Dave Trench who sharpened their
skates, pulled their sleds up the hill, tuned their pianos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
repaired their furniture, took them home from Sunday
evening services when no other escort was available.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vine wants you to do an errand for her, Davy.
Would you mind taking this little package over to the
bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind going to Halifax for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen laid the parcel in his hand. He was to give it
to Mr. Stone. In no case was he to give it to Calvin.
As his lithe figure melted into the gloom of the building
across the way, she turned for the information that was
her due.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my engagement ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve given Calvin the mitten. His father came
down this morning and laboured with me for more than
an hour to get me to change my mind; but I told him I
would never marry a man who smoked and drank and
gambled. That was what I was about to tell you this
morning, when Ted ran in on us. I&#8217;ve had him on probation
since last spring&mdash;for two years, in fact. He&#8217;s
promised me over and over. And yesterday, after he
bought the ring for our wedding, he went and got roaring
drunk&mdash;fell into the hands of some disreputable
woman&mdash;and&mdash; Why, Ellen, when he stopped at the
house last night he was so maudlin that he couldn&#8217;t give
an account of where he&#8217;d been or what had happened to
him. You can guess how we parted. He told his
father this morning that he&#8217;d go to the dogs if I turned
him down. Mr. Stone almost got down on his knees to
me, but it was all wasted. When I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen Porter had but one grievous fault. When she
found herself unable to keep a secret, she did not scruple
to seek help. Lavinia thought afterward it had been almost
an inspiration ... telling Ellen. By Sunday it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would be all over town, each one of Ellen&#8217;s confidantes
pledged to hold the revelation sacred. She knew, too,
how Calvin&#8217;s lapse from virtue would grow with each
fresh telling of the story. By another Sunday it would
be murder he had committed.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The ring delivered, Vine went home to plan the next
move. That she must leave Bromfield before the truth
of Calvin&#8217;s marriage leaked out, she did not so much as
debate. There was an uncle in the wilds of Illinois.
Once she had visited him, with the result that the buffalo
and Indian frontier had receded some leagues farther
to the west. A coal mining town. She remembered
that some adventurous investors dreamed of oil and
natural gas. There ought to be employment for an
energetic, fairly well educated girl who was accustomed
to hard work.</p>

<p>Lavinia Larimore had not been blessed with an elastic
nature, but in moments of desperation she manifested
something like the elasticity of ivory. She could yield,
yet show no after-trace of the yielding. By night her
plans were well on the way towards maturity. She
would write to her uncle, and wait for a reply before telling
her parents of her purpose.</p>

<p>She opened the small drawer of the secretary, only to
discover that it was bare of stamps. Her brother Theodore
would be going to Ellen&#8217;s, and the post office was
not far out of his way. But Ted would ask questions.
No, she would wait for David Trench. He and his
father worked at the shop every evening, and he would
be passing at nine.</p>

<p>Up to this point Lavinia had thought of David as
nothing more than an errand boy. But as she sat by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
window in the gathering dusk, he began to change before
her fevered eyes, to assert his height and the grace of
his strong young hands. She had never thought about
David&#8217;s hands before. Strange that the hard work had
never rendered them unshapely. Calvin&#8217;s hands were
pudgy, the fingers short and thick. She had always been
conscious of Calvin&#8217;s hands&mdash;had viewed them almost
with repugnance even when she craved their touch the
most.</p>

<p>David&#8217;s smile was beautiful. He would grow into a
fine-looking man, like his father. Now that they had
taken to refinishing antique furniture, there would be
money in the shop for two households. David would
always be kind. He might even.... What was she
thinking! A startled laugh burst from her lips. Davy,
little Davy Trench! With a suppressed, &#8220;Huh! I
might go farther and fare worse,&#8221; she tossed the absurd
thought aside. A moment later it presented itself in another
guise. She was still toying with the audacious intruder
when she heard David&#8217;s slow, regular step on the
stone flagging. Through the open window she called his
name. With nervous haste she lighted the tall, flamboyantly
shaded piano lamp and motioned him to a chair.
Then she seated herself rather stiffly on the old-fashioned
sparking settee, her heart pounding, her
tongue thick and useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there something I could do for you, Vine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;mind&mdash;going back to the post office,
Dave? I want to get off an important letter to my uncle.
He wants me to come out to Illinois, and&mdash;there isn&#8217;t a
stamp in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but you can&#8217;t send it to-night. The post
office was closed when I came by, and the last mail goes
up to Rochester at half-past eight. If you had only told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
me sooner.... I&#8217;ll be glad to stop by and get it in the
morning, on my way to the shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s not so urgent. I&#8217;ll have it ready before
breakfast. You won&#8217;t forget to stop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course not, Vine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, would you be sorry if I should go away from
Bromfield&mdash;to stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be Bromfield without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia Larimore took the bit in her teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dave, what do you think Ellen Porter was saying to
me when you came to the store, this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said it was all over town that you and I are going
to be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221; The boy gasped. He gripped the edge of his
chair and the blood died out of his cheeks. &#8220;Vine, you
oughtn&#8217;t to make fun of me that way. It isn&#8217;t kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t making fun of you, Davy. Honest to goodness,
everybody has noticed how much we have been together
lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Calvin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! I broke off with him long ago. Dave, are
you asleep, that you don&#8217;t know it is all over between
Calvin and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid I&#8217;m dreaming now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you aren&#8217;t. You are broad awake, and I&#8217;m telling
you the truth. I would not marry Calvin Stone if
he was the last man left on earth. He is a low-lived
gambler&mdash;and I despise him. He isn&#8217;t worth your little
finger.&#8221;</p>

<p>David slipped from his chair and gained the settee,
somehow, his knees knocking together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vine, do you mean&mdash; Would I be a fool to&mdash;&#8221;
Then his lips found hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>At midnight David Trench stumbled drunkenly home,
his head bumping the stars, while Lavinia took the two-year-old
wedding dress from the cedar chest and planned
to modernize its lines.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV &nbsp; Vine Cottage</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The cottage had been vacant almost four months, an
economic waste that cut deeply into Lavinia Trench&#8217;s pin-money.
Not that David stinted her in the matter of
funds. The purse strings had always lain loosely in
David&#8217;s hands. But her penurious soul, bent on making
the best possible showing of whatever resources came
within her reach, rebelled at the insolent idleness of invested
capital. Vine Cottage had been hers, to do with
as she pleased, since the completion of the big Colonial
mansion that housed the remnant of the Trench family.
There were not half-a-dozen furnished residences to let
in Springdale, and that this one should have been unoccupied
since the middle of November was inexplicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t half way tried to rent it,&#8221; the woman
charged, her eyes shifting from her husband&#8217;s face to
the cottage beyond the low stone wall, with its sullenly
drawn blinds and its air of insensate content. Her
glance rested appraisingly on the broad veranda, now
banked with wet February snow; the little glass-enclosed
breakfast room that had been her own conservatory, in
the years gone by; the sturdy-throated chimney, that
would never draw&mdash;but that none the less served as one
of the important talking points of the cottage. An attractive
set of gas logs did away with the danger of
stale wood smoke in the library; but the chimney remained&mdash;moss-covered
at the corners, near the ground,
a hardy ampelopsis tracing a pattern of brown lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
against its dull red bricks. There were eight rooms and
a capacious attic. The furniture was excellent. There
was a garage, too, with living quarters for the servants.
In the year of grace, nineteen hundred and nine, there
were not many residences in Springdale with garages.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard at church, Sunday, that Mrs. Marksley is
looking for a house. You know, Vine, their place on
Grant Drive is for sale&mdash;against the building of the new
house in Marksley&#8217;s Addition. Do you want me
to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Marksley! Humph!&#8221; Lavinia&#8217;s black eyes
snapped. It would be to her liking to have the wife of
the richest man in town as her tenant. Still ... the
situation had its disadvantages, not the least of which
was that they would be moving out again in a few months,
and the same old problem to be faced afresh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as you like about speaking to Mr. Marksley.
But remember, David, I don&#8217;t recommend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your house, my dear. You blamed me for offering
the place to Sylvia when she was married. I told
you, last fall, I&#8217;d have nothing more to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent to kiss her, a kiss that was part of the compulsory
daily routine, and hurriedly left the house.
Lavinia turned his words over in her mind, and her
gorge rose. David was always that way. You could
never make him shoulder responsibility. True, she had
wanted Sylvia next door, where she could watch over
her daughter&#8217;s blundering beginnings at housekeeping.
And anyone would say it was an honour to have Professor
Penrose in the family&mdash;even if his salary was
small. But another lessee&mdash;with the boon of a commercial
position in Detroit at four times the amount he
received from the little denominational college in Springdale&mdash;would
have been held to the strict interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the lease. David would not hear of Oliver and Sylvia
paying rent for a house they did not occupy, a sentiment
promptly seconded by his daughter. Sylvia never
failed to perceive her own advantage&mdash;a fact at once
gratifying and maddening to her mother. What if
David had been like that? What if.... She always
put David aside. Why bother about the inevitable?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Mr. Trench did not go at once to the office of Trench
&amp; Son, architects and general building contractors. It
was important to his domestic peace that some definite
step be taken towards the renting of the cottage. He
would stop, he thought, at the office of the Argus, and
insert a three-time advertisement. He could bring the
matter up with Henry Marksley, for whom he always
had some construction work on hand. But second
thought deterred him. It might be disastrous to have
young Hal Marksley next door, if only for a few months.
Hal was a senior in the Presbyterian college. His recent
attentions to Eileen Trench, just approaching her
sixteenth birthday, had been disquieting to her father,
none the less because of her mother&#8217;s unconcealed approval.</p>

<p>Eileen was impressionable. A youth of Hal Marksley&#8217;s&mdash;David
searched his mind for the word. Disposition?
He was more than amiable. Principles? Not
quite that, either. In short, there was nothing he could
urge against the young man that had not been set at
naught by Eileen&#8217;s mother. Money had lifted the
Marksleys above the restrictions imposed upon common
people. Their life had been unconventional, at
times positively scandalous. Eileen&#8217;s iconoclastic spirit
would grasp at anything to justify her revolt against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
conventional trammels of her home, the puritanical regulations
which served Lavinia in lieu of religion. There
was enough friction in that quarter already.</p>

<p>As he passed the college campus, with its motley group
of buildings&mdash;dingy red brick of forty years&#8217; standing,
and the impudent modernity of Bedford stone with
trimmings of terra cotta and Carthage marble&mdash;he
caught sight of Dr. Schubert&#8217;s mud-bespattered buggy.
The grey mare, these ten years a stranger to the restraining
tether, nosed contentedly in the snow for the succulent
sprigs that were already making their appearance
among the exposed roots of the huge old elms. From
the opposite side of the street the family physician waved
a driving glove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, David.&#8221; He made his way cautiously
through the ooze of the crudely paved avenue.
&#8220;I was on my way out to your house. Stopped to look
in on a pneumonia that kept me up nearly all night.
Does Mrs. Trench still want to rent the cottage? Or is
it true that Sylvia and Penrose are coming back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are well pleased with Detroit. And my wife
is most anxious for a tenant. You know, Doctor, she
draws the line on children and dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to close a very satisfactory deal.
My old friend, Griffith Ramsay, spent the night with us.
He&#8217;s out here from New York&mdash;some legal business
connected with the mines at Olive Hill, for a client
of his, a Mrs. Ascott. The lady is recently widowed,
and in need of some kind of diversion. I had been telling
him about my experiments, my need for a competent
assistant in the laboratory, and he arrived at the conclusion
that these two needs would neutralize each other.
Mrs. Ascott, having a large financial stake in the mines,
would be interested in the possibility of increasing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
value of soft coal. The more he though about it, the
greater his enthusiasm. The one thing in the way, he
thought, would be a suitable place for her to live. That
was when Vine Cottage popped into my mind. I&#8217;ll send
him around to the office to talk over the details of the
lease with you.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">V &nbsp; Judith Goes West</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mrs. Ascott had an early appointment with her attorney.
An early appointment necessitated her catching
the nine-fifteen train for the city. That, again, implied
the disruption of the entire household regimen,
and Judith Ascott had learned not to try her mother&#8217;s
patience too far. She was the unpleasant note in an
otherwise satisfactory family. True, her mother had
stood by her through all the scandal and unpleasantness.
But the changing of the breakfast hour was quite another
matter.</p>

<p>As she slipped into the pantry of the big suburban
home and set the coffee machine going, she turned over
in her mind another reason for her care not to disturb
the family slumber. She did not know why her attorney
wished to see her&mdash;was not even sure which member of
the firm would be awaiting her, that still March morning.
The long-distance message conveyed the bare information
that the business was urgent. Might there be another
delay in the divorce? She had been assured that
the decree would be in her hands by the end of the week;
but gruff old Sanderson, the senior partner, was not so
sure. Any reference to the &#8220;distasteful affair&#8221; threw
her mother into a nervous chill. A note on the breakfast
table, informing the family that she had caught
the early express for a morning at the art gallery,
would suffice as well as any other explanation.</p>

<p>All the way in, between the snow-decked New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fields and the dreary waste of the Sound, she dwelt moodily
on the unpleasant possibilities of the coming interview.
But when she emerged from the confusion of the
Grand Central station, already in the turmoil of reconstruction,
she thought only of the relative merits of the
taxicab and the subway. She had schooled herself, in
times of stress, to take refuge in irrelevant trifles. She
had learned, too, that the more she worried before the
ordeal the less occasion she found for worry when the
actual conditions confronted her. In view of her sleepless
night, she would probably find roses and Griff Ramsay
instead of thorns and Donald Sanderson.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The attorney had thought it all out, had decided just
how he was going to break the news. But when he
found his client confronting him, across the unaccustomed
barrier of his desk, his assurance forsook him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith, what are you going to do, now that you are
free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I going to do, Griff? That, as usual,
depends on mamma. You know I have never planned
anything&mdash;vital&mdash;in my life. When she lays too much
stress on the &#8216;must&#8217; I do the opposite. She says that I
am going to sail with her and the boys on the fifth of
April, a month from to-day. Ben is going on with his
architecture at the Beaux Arts and Jack is wild about
airplanes. Paris has hideous memories&mdash;but there&#8217;s no
other place for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman started. &#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you have the qualities I believe you have. Judith,
may I for once talk cold unpleasant facts? You are
twenty-seven years old and the life you have made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
yourself is a failure.&#8221; Mrs. Ascott deprecated the
finality of the word, but she let it pass. &#8220;Going to Paris
would only be temporizing. Your mother&#8217;s influence has
always been bad. You and your father are scarcely acquainted.
Your brothers are too young to count.
Laura and I have been your only intimates, since your
return to New York. I need not remind you of our
staunch friendship for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Griff&mdash;tell me what you have in mind. I promise not
to cry out, if I do squirm a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told her of Springdale, the kindly old physician
who had a theory that soft coal could be transformed, at
the mines, into clean fuel and a whole retinue of valuable
by-products&mdash;of his need for a secretary and laboratory
assistant, to keep his records and assist him with experiments.
He told her of Vine Cottage, its wide garden
and fruit trees. &#8220;The house faces south. Get that solidly
established in your mind,&#8221; he admonished. He
knew how important it was for Judith Ascott to be properly
oriented. Other details of the place he painted,
graphic and engaging. She would take with her her old
nurse, Nanny. For servants he had leased Jeff Dutton
and wife, who occupied the rooms above the garage. As
an afterthought he added that she would spend four
mornings a week in Dr. Schubert&#8217;s laboratory. Her
compensation&mdash;a large block of treasury stock in the corporation
that would result from the evolving of a process
for the cleansing of soft coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is this Springdale&mdash;this Utopia? What has
it to do with Sutton and Olive Hill, where the mines are
located?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As little as possible. You&#8217;ll note that Springdale
draws its virtuous white skirts away from those filthy
towns, with an air so smug that it would disgust you if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
it were not so amusingly naïve. It claims ten thousand
inhabitants&mdash;when the census taker isn&#8217;t within
hearing. There is a denominational college&mdash;co-ed, I
believe&mdash;with a conservatory of music and a school of
dramatic art. The President isn&#8217;t the lean sycophant
in a shabby Prince Albert coat that you might expect.
I met him&mdash;a singularly spruce-minded successor to that
old Presbyterian war-horse, Thomas Henderson, who
built the college out of Illinois dirt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds interesting, Griff. Is there any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ever so much. The college isn&#8217;t the whole show,
by any means. At one end of the town is a Bible Institute
and at the other an asylum for the feeble-minded.
There is a manual training school for deaf-mutes and a
sanitarium for drug fiends and booze fighters. On the
whole, quite an intellectual centre. It is under no circumstances
to be confused with Springfield, the capital
of the state. You are sentenced to live there for a year.
At the end of your term you may come back to New
York&mdash;if you haven&#8217;t found yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only last night I was wishing that I could run away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;to
a place I had never heard
of. Do you think I can do the work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that part of it.... My only concern is for
your mother. I&#8217;ll send Laura down to Pelham to help
persuade her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith Ascott&#8217;s finely modelled shoulders came up in an
almost imperceptible shrug. &#8220;Mamma will be so relieved.
Don&#8217;t trouble Laura. I was only going to
Paris because there was no convenient pigeonhole to
stow me away &#8216;till wanted.&#8217; Mamma, of course, hopes
that I will marry. She wouldn&#8217;t want me tagging
around after her, the rest of her life. <i>You</i> know that
I am done with men.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; Ramsay interrupted, &#8220;I led those people
to suppose your husband was dead. It&#8217;s that kind of
town. Not the old doctor, understand. His sympathy&#8217;s
as wide as humanity. But your next-door neighbours&mdash;excellent
people, though with small-town limitations.
You&#8217;ll have to depend on them for such social
life as your gregarious nature demands. How soon can
you be ready to go west?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I can bring Nanny from Vermont. I
ought to be on my way in a week.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Later in the day, when she found herself alone in a
quiet corner of the Metropolitan, Mrs. Ascott turned
the preposterous proposition over in her mind. No
doubt the Ramsays were as tired of her eternal flopping
from one untenable situation to another as her own
people were. In Springdale she would be safely off their
hands ... at least until the sensation of her divorce
had subsided. Would her late husband marry the nonchalant
co-respondent? Would Herbert Faulkner, with
whom she had all but eloped, while Raoul Ascott and the
girl were in Egypt.... But she was not interested in
Herbert Faulkner, and she cared not a straw whether
Raoul married or pursued his butterfly career, free from
the stimulating restrictions of domestic life. Was Griff
afraid she would disturb the farcical relations of her late
impassioned admirer and the stern-lipped woman who
bore his name and made free with his check-book to further
her aberrant social ambition? Was it for this that
she had been banished to the coal fields of western Illinois&mdash;to
save Maida Faulkner the annoyance of a divorce
and consequent loss of income? Whatever the actuating
motive, the thing was done. She had acquiesced
without a murmur of protest. This was in keeping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
her whole nondescript life. Nothing had been worth
the effort of opposition. She had never known the stinging
contact of human suffering. Oh, to burn her fingers
with the flame of living! But Springdale&mdash;a hide-bound
college town, where divorce is reckoned among
the cardinal sins....</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI &nbsp; The Trench Children</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Lavinia stood in the sun-room, staring perplexedly
across the lawn in the direction of Vine Cottage. She
was trying to decide a ponderous question. To call on
the new tenant ... or to wait the prescribed two
weeks? David and the children felt that a neighbourly
visit was already overdue. Probably, Larimore had
said at breakfast, Mrs. Ascott knew nothing of the silly
custom which prevailed in Springdale, and would think
her landlady either hostile or rude. For once in her
life Lavinia Trench was uncertain. The new tenant was
a woman of the world. Ominous distinction. How
could one gauge a neighbour who had crossed the ocean
sixteen times and had lived in every European capital
from London to Constantinople? She did not wear
black. Incomprehensible for a widow. Likely as not,
she held Springdale unworthy the display of her expensive
weeds. Or perhaps she was saving them for some
adequate occasion. Just going to Dr. Schubert&#8217;s laboratory
to work ... one&#8217;s old clothes would serve for
that. Besides, there were so many new fads about
mourning. It might be that taupe was the correct thing.
She would write and ask Sylvia about it.</p>

<p>Sylvia was the one member of the family whose opinion
was accorded a meed of respect&mdash;now that she had
gone to Detroit to live. It was too bad that she should
have moved to another city, just when a woman who
might have been of service to her had come to Springdale.
It was always that way. Life offered the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
desideratum&mdash;after the wish or need for it had gone by.
Life, Lavinia Trench&#8217;s life, was an endless chain of disappointments.
Of this there was no shadow of doubt.
David and the children had heard the statement reiterated
with such consistent regularity that they failed now
to hear it at all&mdash;like the noise of the trolley cars on
Sherman Avenue, behind the Trench home, that at first
made such a deafening clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to get everything you ask for,&#8221; her second
son, Robert, had once reminded her. &#8220;That&#8217;s more
than you can say for the rest of us.&#8221; Whereat she reeled
off such a catalogue of woes that even Bob was silenced.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>There was something abnormal about the Trench children.
Nothing ever went right with them. Sylvia was
the college beauty, an exact replica of her mother, and
she had been forced in sheer desperation to marry, at
twenty-four, the baldheaded professor of chemistry and
physics, whom half the girls in town had refused. Larimore
was a successful architect, had taken honours at
Cornell; but he detested girls and boys. Had his nose in
a book most of the time. He might have done things for
his sister, if he had not been so steeped in his own morbid
fancies. Bob would have brought eligible young
men to the house, if he had been the next one in age to
Sylvia. Mrs. Trench shuddered when she thought about
Bob. It was the culminating tragedy of her badly ordered
life.</p>

<p>A good many things made her shudder ... horrible
patches of the past, that had been lived through, somehow.
There were the first few years of her married life
at Olive Hill, when David worked as a carpenter, and
two babies invaded the three-room cottage before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
second anniversary. She had not considered the possibility
of children when, after an engagement lasting less
than a month, she and David had been married. A
little daughter&mdash;three weeks older than Ellen&#8217;s first
child! Lavinia made it an occasion for rejoicing. Sent
dainty announcements to Bromfield, tied with blue ribbon.
But when, after fourteen months, a boy came, she
began to question the leap she had made, that tempestuous
October day.</p>

<p>The boy was called Larimore, in protest against the
unmistakable lineaments of the Trenches that revealed
themselves in his pathetic baby face. He was an
anaemic child, given to wailing softly when in pain&mdash;a
sharp contrast to Sylvia&#8217;s insistent screams. As he grew
into boyhood he was quiet and studious, as David had
been. Seldom gave his mother cause for anxiety, glutted
her maternal pride with his achievements at school, and
yet she never quite overcame the feeling that he was an
interloper in her family. There were three years of immunity,
and then came Robert, the child whom everybody
else regarded as a stray. But Lavinia saw in his thick
black hair and virile body the materialization of her contempt
for David&#8217;s softness, as it had perpetuated itself
in her first son.</p>

<p>There was nothing about Bob that was soft but his
skin. And that was another Trench anomaly. Between
Lary&#8217;s curling blond locks and Bob&#8217;s peach bloom complexion,
Sylvia had a desperate time of it, before the
period of adolescence when her own sallow cheeks began
to clear. Those were the dim prehistoric days when,
in Springdale, rouge and lip sticks carried all the sinister
implication which had attached, in the Bromfield of Lavinia&#8217;s
day, to the suggested idea that a &#8220;nice&#8221; girl
wanted to marry. There was implicit in each the stigma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the wanton, and Lavinia had taught her children that,
before all else, they must be respectable. Her own powder
box was closely guarded, its existence denied with
oaths that would have condemned a less righteous soul
to perdition.</p>

<p>After David removed to Springdale, as junior member
of the firm that had the contract for two new buildings
on the college campus, and Vine Cottage had been
erected beyond the residence district of the town, three
other babies arrived&mdash;at perfectly decent intervals.
They were all girls. Isabel, like Lary, was given an
unequivocal Larimore name, because she was so exactly
like her father. She was four years younger than Bob,
and the death of these two made a strange break in the
family continuity. Mrs. Ascott heard about the Trench
children in a manner at once vivid and enlightening.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was the ninth day of her tenancy at Vine Cottage,
and she and Dr. Schubert were already old friends.
With the exception of a reference to Eileen, whom the
quality rather than the content of his allusion marked as
his favourite, he had studiously avoided any comment on
the Trenches that would serve to divert the free flow of
her own sensitive perception. Larimore and Sydney
Schubert were of about the same age&mdash;had been intimate
friends from boyhood. Syd&#8217;s affection for Lary, at one
period of his youth, had overflowed and engulfed Sylvia.
But Mrs. Trench had set her face sternly against any
such alliance. &#8220;The obstacle seems to have been that intangible
thing, a discrepancy in age&mdash;on the wrong side
of the ledger,&#8221; the physician explained. &#8220;<i>There</i> is one
woman,&#8221; he stressed the first word extravagantly, his eyes
twinkling, &#8220;who has the whole scheme of life crystallized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
With most of us, certain problems remain fluid. Mrs.
Trench <i>knows</i>. The eternal verities don&#8217;t admit of argument.
My boy was only a medical student when he
went mooning after Sylvia, but his prospects were good.
If he had been born the day before&mdash;instead of lagging
a stupid sixteen months after the girl&mdash;it would have
been all right for her to wait ten years for him. As it
was, he simply wouldn&#8217;t do. Mrs. Trench objected to
Walter Marksley on entirely different grounds. Mrs.
Trench is strong for the moral code, and Walter kept
a fairly luxuriant crop of wild oats in his front yard....
But my dear, my dear, I&#8217;m developing the garrulity that
is a sure harbinger of old age. Don&#8217;t let a word I&#8217;ve
been saying serve to bias you in your estimate of your
landlady. I assure you, she&#8217;s a trump.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Judith reflected, on the way home that morning, that
if she wanted to get on with Mrs. Trench, she must
guard her own questionable past with double zeal. It
came to her, with a curious feeling of separation, that
she might care what Mrs. Trench thought. The concept
was a new one, and she inspected it with interest. But
then ... she had been so desperately lonely, so remote
from everything she had known in the past. And she
was, as Griff Ramsay suggested, a gregarious animal&mdash;recognizing
only in its absence her need of the herd.
For the sake of Griff and Laura she would endure her exile
to the end, and she was, it seemed, dependent on the
morally austere woman in the great Colonial house for
such human contact as Springdale might offer&mdash;human
contact which for the first time in her life she craved with
poignant longing.</p>

<p>Nanny met her at the door, her face red with laughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
her ample sides shaking. There had been a gravel
fight between Jeff Dutton and one of the Trench children.
It appeared to be one of the regular institutions of Vine
Cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must hurry with your luncheon, Miss Judith, so
as not to miss the next round. The little girl was furious.
She said Dutton muffed his play, and that was
against the rules. She&#8217;s coming back to settle with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny had prepared an unusually tempting repast, in
the tiny breakfast room that looked out, with many windows,
on the stretch of lawn that separated the two
houses, on the little wicket gate in the low stone wall, and
the ample kitchen garden beyond the wall, brown and
scarred with the first spring spading. The lonely woman
viewed, with chill apprehension, the imposing façade
of the house, the crisp white curtains that served, with
their thin opacity, to conceal all the activity of the
Trench home life. A sugar-coated sphinx, that house,
guarding its secret soul with a subtle reticence that belied
its seeming candour. Larimore Trench had drawn the
plans for the new home. Was he that sort of man&mdash;or
was this another expression of the ubiquitous Lavinia,
whom Dutton had characterized as &#8220;running the hull
ranch&#8221;?</p>

<p>There was a commotion in the hall that led from the
kitchen to the breakfast room, and Nanny opened the
door. She was plainly perplexed. Miss Judith was
still a child to her, but she was too instinctively a servant
to venture upon the prerogative of her mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let me by,&#8221; a shrill voice piped. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
tell her, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The housekeeper yielded to a vicious pinch in the
rotund cushion of her thigh, and a small parcel of humanity
slid adroitly into Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s field of vision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Her head was set defiantly on one side, but the dark
eyes were inscrutable. A moment only she faltered,
tucking in her long under lip and shifting her slight bulk
from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I broke a window in your garage. It was Jeff&#8217;s fault.
He had no business ducking. How did he know I had
a rock in that handful of gravel? Just gravel wouldn&#8217;t
have broken the window. I&#8217;m willing to shoulder the
blame, and pay for the glass out of my allowance&mdash;if
you&#8217;ll make Jeff put it in. I can swipe that much putty
from my papa&#8217;s shop. And&mdash;and don&#8217;t let Jeff Dutton
snitch on me&mdash;to Lary.&#8221;</p>

<p>She finished with an excited gasp, and stood awaiting
the inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, little girl. Don&#8217;t mind about the pane.
Are you Eileen Trench?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Mercy, no!&#8221; Astonishment dissolved into mirth,
mirth that savoured of derision. The next instant the
laugh died and the high forehead was puckered in a
frown of swift displeasure. She came a step nearer, her
thin brown hand plucking at her skirt. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
have laughed that way, as if you&#8217;d said something silly.
It goes hard with me to say I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;because&mdash;usually
I&#8217;m not. I hate lying, just to be polite. Eileen&#8217;ll take
a lickin&#8217; any day, before she&#8217;ll say she&#8217;s sorry. But Sylvia
says it&#8217;s better to apologize and be done with it. And
I guess it does save time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ideas appeared chaotic, as if the child were in the
throes of a mighty change in ethical standards. Judith
looked at her, a whimsical fancy taking possession of
her mind that she was watching some fantastic mime&mdash;that
this was no flesh-and-blood child, but an owl masquerading
in wren&#8217;s attire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>&#8220;My dear old doctor mentioned Sylvia and Lary and
Eileen. Would you mind telling me your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodora.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodora&mdash;the gift of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it was a rummy gift. Jeff Dutton says the
Lord hung a lemon on my mother&#8217;s Christmas tree. I
was supposed to come a boy&mdash;there&#8217;d been too many girls
already&mdash;and they were going to name me after my uncle
Theodore. Jeff thinks I cried so much because I was
disappointed at being just a girl. I guess I cried, all
right. My brother, Bob, named me &#8216;Schubert&#8217;s Serenade&#8217;
because he and Lary had me &#8217;neath their casement
every night till two o&#8217;clock. Mamma&#8217;s room was where
your library is now. I like this house lots better than
ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember this one? I thought the new
house was built five years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theodora turned questioning eyes upon her. Then,
in a flash, she understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, you have an idea I&#8217;m about six years old.
Strangers always do. I can&#8217;t help it that I never grow
any bigger. I was twelve last Christmas, and I&#8217;m first
year Prep. It&#8217;s horrid to be so little. People never
have any respect for you. Eileen&#8217;s tall as a broom&mdash;but
nobody has much respect for her, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about Eileen. Dr. Schubert is fond of her,
I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he sees good in her. He&#8217;s about the only one
who does. She was sixteen last Sunday, and she&#8217;s third
year Prep. Goes into college next fall, if she don&#8217;t flunk
again. She&#8217;s getting too big for mamma&#8217;s slipper, and
I don&#8217;t know what is going to become of her. She&#8217;s been
ugly as sin, ever since mamma heard a Chautauqua lecturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
say you had to go in for technique. You know,
Eileen plays the violin. And when mamma shuts her up
and makes her practice&mdash;she gets even by making her
fiddle swear. It says &#8216;hell&#8217; and &#8216;damn&#8217; and some worse
ones, just as plain. And when she&#8217;s mad, her eyes get
as yellow as cat&#8217;s eyes. You never saw yellow eyes, did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own look that way, at times&mdash;when I&#8217;m ill or
out of sorts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re the loveliest&mdash;like gray violets!&#8221; She
looked deep into Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s eyes, and her own kindled
with admiration. &#8220;Dr. Schubert told us yours were like
Lary&#8217;s. But they aren&#8217;t, a bit. His are light brown.
That barely saves him from being a Trench.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manifestly Lavinia had impressed on her family the
advantage of looking like the Larimores. And yet,
Judith thought she had never seen a finer looking man
than David Trench&mdash;not so well groomed as his son, and
with the gait of a man perennially tired, but with a face
that Fra Angelico would have loved to paint.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>When the elfin child had gone, in response to the ringing
of a great bell on the distant campus, Mrs. Ascott sat
a long while in smiling silence. Not in years had she
been so entertained. Bit by bit she added the child&#8217;s
revelations to the broken comments of her garrulous
gardener. The Duttons had been neighbours of the
Trenches in Olive Hill, when Jeff and Dave were fellow
workmen, and before Jeff&#8217;s baleful visit to the &#8220;Jag Institoot&#8221;
that robbed him of his prowess as a brick mason,
along with the appetite for undiluted whiskey. Mrs.
Dutton &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very friendly&#8221; because her fortunes had
declined until she was compelled to serve as laundress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and house-maid to Mrs. Trench&#8217;s tenants. But there
was a time when she and her husband were glad of a
refuge in the rooms above the garage. This small brick
structure, it transpired, had been David&#8217;s work shop,
and here Lary had made his first architectural drawings.</p>

<p>Theodora&#8217;s prattle fairly bristled with Lary. Whatever
his mother might think of him, in his little sister&#8217;s
eyes he was the one flawless being. It was he who had
supervised the furnishing of Vine Cottage, for a certain
Professor Ferguson, a testy little Scot in charge of the
department of biology at the college. And Lary and his
mother had almost broken heads over some of the details.</p>

<p>Everything about the house was exquisite. Judith
thought she knew what Lary would be like&mdash;the man
who could limit himself to a single dull blue and yellow
vase for the library mantel. The external appearance
of the cottage had promised fustian ... the fish-scale
ornament above the bay-window, the elaborate carvings
between the veranda pillars, the somewhat fussy pergola
that covered the gravel walk from the kitchen to the
garage.</p>

<p>Bare vines were everywhere, swelling with sap and
viridescent with eager buds that strove with their armour
of winter scales, although it was not yet the end of
March. Beds of narcissus and tulips gave promise of
early bloom, and already the yellow and white crocus
blossoms were starring the withered bluegrass of the
front lawns. There was an unwritten law that the lattice
which screened the vegetable garden must never carry
anything but cypress and Japanese morning glories, and
that potatoes must be planted east of the pergola. There
were other unwritten &#8220;musts&#8221; that came to light, day by
day, all of them having to do with the garden, over which
apparently Mrs. Trench had retained control.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;But, Lordee, you don&#8217;t have to pay no attention to
her,&#8221; Dutton sniffed, when a rather arbitrary ruling was
undergoing vicarious transmission. &#8220;Treat her like Ferguson
did, the fust time she butted in. It&#8217;s <i>your</i> house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between Dutton and Theodora, it would not be long
until all the Trench skeletons had been dragged from
their closets and set dancing in hilarious abandon, for the
amusement of the new tenant. They were not real
people, the Duttons and the Trenches, with their unfamiliar
life-experience. She had never envisaged anyone
like them. It was all a part of the dream she had cherished&mdash;a
place she had never heard of, where she could
lose herself ... and forget....</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII &nbsp; Lavinia Pays a Call</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>In the pigeonholes of her memory, Mrs. Ascott
had stowed a collection of unanswered questions, neatly
tabulated and reserved for possible solution. Why had
her marriage with Raoul been the inevitable failure she
knew it must be, almost from the beginning? Would they
have found each other if there had been children?
Would her own life have been more satisfactory, had her
mother married for love and not for social position?
And now she added another, trivial as compared with
these, yet quite as elusive: Would Mrs. Trench have
waited the prescribed two weeks for a first call on a new
neighbour, had her small daughter failed to report the
broken window&mdash;and other things?</p>

<p>Whatever the answer, the stubborn fact remained that
Mrs. David Trench did call, on Friday afternoon. She
left a correctly engraved card on the vestibule table, and
sat erect on the edge of her chair. She wore an austere
tailored suit, patent leather boots that called attention
to the trim shape of her feet, and a flesh-tinted veil of
fine silk net with flossy black dots. In the full light of
the south window, she might have passed for thirty-six.
Barring a conspicuous hardness of the mouth, her
features were excellent. The hair that lay in palpably
artificial curls along the line of her velvet hat was as black
as it is possible for Caucasian hair to be, and the eyes
were coldly piercing&mdash;as if appraisal were their chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
function. But her speech.... Cloying sweetness
trickled through her words, as she assured her tenant
that they were destined to be friends. She would come
and care for Mrs. Ascott if she should fall ill&mdash;so far
from home and mother. She was a famous nurse. Dr.
Schubert would bear her witness. Her heart ached as
she thought how desolate must be the life of a young
widow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; she added, &#8220;it is an enviable state, after all&mdash;when
one has passed the first shock of grief. Like
everything in life, it has its compensations. You don&#8217;t
have to bother with a man, and there is no danger of
your being an old maid.&#8221; She pronounced the last words
as if she were referring to the plague or small-pox. &#8220;The
West must look strange to you,&#8221; she hurried on, &#8220;a little
town, too, after spending all your life in New York and
the great cities of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have spent very little time in New York,&#8221; her tenant
corrected. &#8220;When I was married I went to Philadelphia
to live&mdash;such time as we were not travelling.
And I was scarcely away from Rochester until I was
fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rochester! You don&#8217;t tell me! We went to Rochester
for shopping and the theatre, as people in Springdale
go to St. Louis. What a little world it is, after all.
Did you ever hear of a town called Bromfield?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith searched her memory. At last she had it.
She had driven to that village more than once with her
grandfather, Dr. Holden. She recalled one visit, when
the sleigh was insecurely anchored in front of a house on
Main Street, while she curled up for a nap in the great
fur robes on the seat. The horse, arriving at the mental
state which demanded dinner, before the physician was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
ready to leave the house, had untied the hitching strap
and cantered unconcernedly to the livery stable where he
was in the habit of being fed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you were the little girl in the
sleigh!&#8221; Mrs. Trench&#8217;s eyes were scintillating with astonished
interest. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the account of it&mdash;in the
Bromfield Sentinel. I have a complete file of the little
home paper. And it will surprise you to know that the
man your grandfather was calling on was Robert Larimore,
my father. He died of brain hemorrhage, that
same night. All the Larimores go that way&mdash;suddenly.
Dr. Holden was called, when my father&#8217;s mother died,
but it was all over before the telegram reached him.
And your grandmother ... she must have been the
Mrs. Holden who did so much work among the poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my parents left Rochester to escape from her
pets. That, of course, is only a family joke. My
father spent a good many years in South America, and I
was left with my grandparents. One of my brothers
was born in Bolivia and the other in the Argentine. I
didn&#8217;t see them until they were six and ten years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trench was not listening. Should she ... or
should she not? In the end, she did. &#8220;Mrs. Ascott, I
know it sounds like a foolish question&mdash;a city the size of
Rochester&mdash;but you said a moment ago that as a child
you knew everybody. Did you ever hear of a family
named Fournier?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The people who kept the delicatessen, around the
corner from my grandfather&#8217;s private sanitarium? Yes,
I knew them well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there a daughter&mdash;Lettie or Arletta&mdash;some
such name? She&#8217;d be a woman of about forty-five by
this time, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>&#8220;No, she was the niece, a wild, highstrung girl who
gave them a good deal of trouble. She ran away and
was married, at sixteen&mdash;some worthless fellow from up-state,
who afterward tried to get out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worthless?&#8221; Mrs. Trench bristled unaccountably.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the way Lettie&#8217;s people regarded him.
Their little boy and I played together, as children. My
grandmother took a lively interest in Lettie, as she did
in all wayward girls who found no sympathy at home.
I remember she devoted a good deal of her time to the
patching up of quarrels between Lettie and her husband&mdash;and
keeping peace in the family, when he was in Rochester
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there anything&mdash;peculiar&mdash;about their marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lettie was romantic. I believe that was all. It
happened before I was born; but I remember that there
was always talk. Grandma Holden compelled her to
confess her marriage, to save her good name. And the
foolish part of it was that she and the youth were married
under assumed names&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy&mdash;how old is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a very amusing coincidence, I happen to know
that, too. I couldn&#8217;t tell you the ages of my brothers,
with any degree of certainty. But Fournier Stone and I
were born the same night, in adjoining rooms of Dr.
Holden&#8217;s sanitarium. He arrived early in the evening,
and I a little before dawn. By that much I escaped the
&#8216;April Fool&#8217; that was so offensive to him. I shall be
twenty-seven next Friday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trench made swift mental calculation, and her
stiffly pursed lips uttered one inexplicable sentence:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, my people have always been respectable.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Lavinia went home, her whole being in turmoil. She
had not seen Bromfield since the day when she and David
packed their scant belongings and turned to seek oblivion
or happiness in Olive Hill. With the exception of the
Sentinel and her sister-in-law&#8217;s verbose letters, she knew
little of the course of events in that quiet back-water that
had environed her stagnant girlhood. And Ellen left
large gaps in the village news, gaps that could be filled,
inadequately, by inference or imagination. That Calvin
had a child, this much she knew. That he had spent
most of his time in Rochester, prior to his father&#8217;s long
illness and death, this, too, had been conveyed to her by a
random personal notice now and then. But that he and
Lettie had gotten on badly&mdash;had quarreled.... Cruel
joy burned in her eyes. They had had recourse to the
neighbours, to smooth out their family affairs. Whatever
unpleasantness she had had, within the four walls of
her own home, none of the neighbours had been permitted
to suspect that her life was not all she wished it to be.
The neighbours. What kind of woman was Mrs. Stone,
that she would.... But Lavinia knew, at last, what
kind of woman Mrs. Stone was. She reflected that
Lettie&#8217;s marriage certificate probably had not been
framed in gold, as hers was, and conspicuously displayed
on the wall of her bedroom. The past ten years, the
Stones had prospered, and Calvin had succeeded his
father as president of the bank. Ellen and Lettie were
on calling terms. She would write Ellen....</p>

<p>In memory she went back to the days when Vine Cottage
was new, when to her fell the task of choosing a line
of social progress in the clique-ridden town of Springdale.
She had three small children, ample excuse for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
little dalliance. And the cottage, with two hundred
feet of ground to be transformed into a marvellous garden,
was a little way out&mdash;a double reason for delay,
when David urged her to return the calls of the Eastern
Star ladies, who had been most gracious. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
to make any mistake,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;If you once get in
with the wrong set....&#8221; David didn&#8217;t know what
she meant.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Society in Springdale, such society as counted for anything,
was divided by a clearly marked line of cleavage,
with Mrs. Henry Marksley dominating one stratum and
Mrs. Thomas Henderson the other. The Hendersons
were leaders in the intellectual life of the community
and staunch pillars in the Presbyterian church. Lavinia
was glad that David had been brought up a Presbyterian&mdash;or
rather, that that happened to be the fashionable
church in Springdale. When it came to matters of principle,
it was not easy to manipulate David.</p>

<p>The Marksleys seldom went to church. On the other
hand, Mr. Marksley stood ready with three contracts,
before David had finished the work on the campus, contracts
which enabled him to reap the benefit of his labour,
instead of delivering two-thirds of the profits into the
hand of the senior partner. Mrs. Marksley was particularly
anxious to rally to her standard the best looking
and aggressive young women of the town. She was trying
to live down the latest escapades of her husband and
her eldest daughter, Adelaide. Such a woman as Mrs.
David Trench would be of service to her&mdash;and she could
make the association correspondingly profitable. But at
the psychological moment Mrs. Marksley went into
temporary social exile, ceasing all activity until after the
birth of a son. The hiatus, together with certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
whispered stories concerning Adelaide, drove Lavinia
to Mrs. Henderson and the Browning Club. It was a
step she never regretted. Within a year she was able
to send to the Bromfield Sentinel an account of a spirited
business meeting, at which &#8220;young Mrs. Trench&#8221; had
been elected secretary, over the heads of two rival candidates
whose husbands were in the college faculty.
Mrs. Henderson was perpetual president, and membership
in the club gave just the right intellectual and cultural
stamp.</p>

<p>Years afterward, Tom Henderson and Walter Marksley
began an exciting race for Sylvia&#8217;s favour&mdash;courtship
that came to nothing, as all Sylvia&#8217;s courtship did.
And now, the boy whose advent had settled, once and
for all, Mrs. Trench&#8217;s social destiny, was playing around
with Eileen, taking her to and from school in his car and
ruining her digestion with parfait and divinity. David
and Larimore&mdash;to his mother he was always Larimore,
never Lary&mdash;had set their faces stubbornly against this
flattering attachment. There had been no scandal in the
Marksley family in recent years, and no other objection
that a sensible person could name. But how to persuade
them.... Mrs. Ascott! To be sure. It was providential
that she had come to Springdale at such an opportune
time. She would see things in their true light&mdash;being
a woman of the world. If only Larimore could be induced
to call on her. She was&mdash;m-m-m, yes, nineteen
months older than Larimore. That made it safe. A
young widow.... But Larimore Trench had never
been interested in any woman. She would trump up
some reason for sending him over, that very evening.
She must have Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s assistance. Eileen&#8217;s future&mdash;her
own future, for reasons as yet but dimly apprehended&mdash;was
at stake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>But Theodora spared her the trouble. Judith was
finishing her lonely dinner when the telephone rang.
&#8220;I&#8217;m bringing my brother over to see you. I told him
you wanted some changes made in the living-room.&#8221; In
a muffled whisper she added: &#8220;Of course you didn&#8217;t; but
I&#8217;ll explain. We&#8217;ll be there in a minute.&#8221; Before she
could reply, the receiver had clicked into its hook, and
the two were seen emerging from the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott, this is Lary. It&#8217;s the lamp shade, the
one on the newel post&mdash;you know&mdash;that&#8217;s the colour of
ripe apricots.&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted from the vestibule into the wide living-room,
from which a stairway ascended to the floor above,
and turned on the light, although the day was not yet
gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like it?&#8221; Larimore Trench, asked. &#8220;This
colour scheme, I know, is a bit personal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, child, when did I say such a thing? I don&#8217;t recall
discussing the lamp shade with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t exactly tell him you said that you objected
to it. I said I <i>thought</i> you did. You see, mamma told
us at dinner that you agreed with her in everything.
And she has always said that for this room the lamp
shade must be rose pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to disagree with your mother, but I should
not like rose pink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott,&#8221; Lary began, his clear brown eyes
mock-serious, &#8220;I must warn you that Miss Theodora
Trench is a conscienceless little fibber. It isn&#8217;t her only
fault, but it is her most serious one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary! To think of <i>you</i>&mdash;giving me a black eye,
right before Lady Judith! When I haven&#8217;t had a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to make good with her. If mamma or Eileen....
But <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make either of them any blacker than they
already are, dearie. And I didn&#8217;t mean to humiliate
you. But you mustn&#8217;t begin by fibbing to Mrs. Ascott.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hung her head, crimson blotches staining the sallow
cheeks. After a moment she looked up, and the
angry fire had been extinguished by shining tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s better this way. Now Lady Judith
knows what kind of a family we are. You can&#8217;t get disappointed
in people if you know the worst of them
first.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>It transpired that within the Trench home the new
tenant had already been established as &#8220;Lady Judith,&#8221; a
name which Theodora afterward explained, with documentary
and graphic evidence to substantiate her none
too credible word. A long time ago Lary had given her
a book of fairy tales, the heroine of which was Lady
Judith Dinglewood&mdash;beloved of all the bold knights, but
destined for the favour of the king&#8217;s son. Lary had
adorned the title-page with a miniature of the beautiful
lady, and had added a colophon showing her in the robes
of a royal bride. Theodora could recite every word of
the romantic tale before she was old enough to read.
She had gone to sleep with that book in her arms, as
Sylvia had insisted on taking her best wax doll to bed.
The moment she espied the name, Judith Ascott, on the
lease that Griffith Ramsay had signed, she decided that
her Lady Judith had come true.</p>

<p>It mattered little that the new occupant of the name
bore not the slightest resemblance to the two little water
colour drawings. Lary could paint a new Lady Judith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
now that he knew what she really looked like. It was
not his fault that he had made the eyes black. He had
to do that, to appease mamma and Sylvia&mdash;whose standards
of beauty were rigidly fixed. But eyes that could
be blue or grey, or flecked with brown, as they were this
evening.... How much more interesting than eyes
that were always the same colour! The hair, in that new
picture which Lary must paint, would be pale chestnut,
with golden glints where the light fell on it. And the
mouth&mdash;the sweetest mouth! She told Lary about it as
they went home, through the close dark of a wonderful
spring night. Had he noticed Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s mouth?
He had.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VIII &nbsp; Hal Marksley Intrudes</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>April brought a break in the stolid serenity of Elm
Street. The big house across from the Trench property
began to manifest signs of awakening life. For almost
a year it had stood vacant, with only a caretaker to guard
it against the depredations of Springdale&#8217;s budding
youth. Paint and pruning shears had scarcely achieved
the miracle of external transformation when a consignment
of furniture arrived, via the Oriental express and
San Francisco. This much Theodora discovered as she
risked her fragile bones among the packing cases in the
reception hall. She had contrived to make out four
letters, N-I-M-S, in great smears of glossy black ink on
several of the boxes. That hardly sounded like a name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma says it will be time enough to find out about
them when they move in,&#8221; she complained to Mrs. Ascott.
&#8220;I heard her ask the agent&mdash;and she was mad as
hops when he refused to tell her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightfully mysterious, Theo. Perhaps some
European monarch has grown tired of his crown, and is
coming to live across the street from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the Emperor of China. I saw the loveliest
great red dragon&mdash;where one of the cases had broken
open and the burlap was torn off. Oh&mdash;&#8221; in sudden
fright, &#8220;don&#8217;t let Lary know I pried.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had perceived her brother&#8217;s approach, by some
subtle sense that bound them. He and Eileen were
crossing the lawn with noiseless steps and Theodora&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
back was turned. When they reached the front gate,
Mrs. Ascott gave greeting:</p>

<p>&#8220;What does one do in Springdale, these glorious spring
evenings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One goes to the show, if one has an amiable
brother.&#8221; To Eileen&#8217;s suggestion, Larimore added:
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come along, Mrs. Ascott? Vaudeville and
pictures&mdash;not much of an attraction; but it might amuse
you. My mother is entertaining the ladies of the missionary
society this evening, and she doesn&#8217;t want us
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Theodora added, &#8220;and Mrs. Stevens is coming.
She and Eileen don&#8217;t speak, since the &#8216;ossified episode.&#8217;
You know, Lady Judith, that&#8217;s all that saved you from
being invited to join the Self Culture Club. Mamma belongs.
She was one of the charter members&mdash;reads the
magazine, like it was the Bible&mdash;and she meant it for a
compliment to offer your name for membership. But
Mrs. Stevens was so furious at Eileen that she tabled all
the names mamma submitted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have gone in for that rubbish anyway,&#8221;
Eileen defended herself. &#8220;Mrs. Stevens makes me
tired. She hasn&#8217;t a thing in her library but reference
works. And mamma holds her up to Theo and me as a
bright example. Tells us that we can&#8217;t expect to get
culture unless we look things up. Ina Stevens does that,
and she has facts hanging all over her. She&#8217;s as prissy
as her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what was the &#8216;ossified episode&#8217;?&#8221; Judith asked,
recognizing one of Larimore Trench&#8217;s expressions,
wherewith Theodora&#8217;s speech was frequently adorned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph, I got caught on the word, in rhetoric class.
Thought it meant something about kissing, and the whole
class hooted at me. Ina was at home, sick, that day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and Theo and I went over in the evening to take her
credit card. Her marks were loads better&#8217;n mine,
and Mrs. Stevens swelled up so about it that I couldn&#8217;t
help telling her that my grandfather was expected to
die, because all his bones had ossified. And, Mrs. Ascott,
both of them&mdash;Ina and her mother&mdash;fell for it.
Mrs. Stevens said it was a dreadful disease, but she had
known one old lady who lived three years in that condition.
I looked blank as a grindstone; but Theo had to
go and snigger. And after we went home, Mrs. Stevens
looked it up&mdash;and &#8217;phoned mamma that I had to apologize,
or she wouldn&#8217;t let Ina chum with me any more. I
don&#8217;t care. I like Kitten Henderson best, any way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to look anxiously up the street, as if she
were more than half expecting some one, while Judith
went into the house to get her hat.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The performance had been going on for an hour when
the four entered the theatre, groping their way down the
dark aisle to a row of unoccupied seats at the left side.
The stage was being set for a troupe of Japanese tumblers,
and the interval was bridged by news films and an
animated cartoon. To Judith this form of entertainment
was new. Raoul could tolerate nothing but the
sprightliest comedy. With the Ramsays and Herbert
Faulkner she had tried to find surcease in grand opera
and the symphony. Once in London she and her mother
had taken refuge from the rain in a cinema theatre
where, on a wide screen, a company of fat French women
chased a terrified little man&mdash;who had loved not
wisely but too often&mdash;through the familiar streets of the
Latin Quarter, overturning flower stands and vegetable
carts, falling in scrambled heaps that writhed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
brave showing of lingerie, untangling themselves and
scampering to fresh disaster, when they discovered that
the object of their jealous rage had somehow slipped unhurt
from the mass. Mrs. Denslow was disgusted.
Judith was only bored.</p>

<p>But this bit of screen craft was different. On an expanse
of dazzling white a single black dot appeared,
paused a breathless moment and went tripping about
in a zigzag dance, spilling smaller dots as it went.
These resolved themselves into figures that stalked about
with the jerky motion of automata. A ghostly hand
passed over the picture, and it stood revealed a plenum
of regularly arranged dots. With another wave of the
wraithlike hand, the dots began to move slowly to and
fro, advancing and retreating until they assumed the outlines
of a great picture, &#8220;Washington Crossing the Delaware.&#8221;
Other pictures were produced by means of
those same dots. But Mrs. Ascott, who had never before
watched the vibrant changes of an animated cartoon,
found it necessary to close her eyes to relieve the
strain. And then ... some one was leaning over her
shoulder, heavy with the odour of a spent cigar, and a
full, authoritative voice was saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Eileen. The whole bunch is down in
front. Ina and Jimmy are there, and Kitten and Dan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal Marksley, if you can&#8217;t come to the house for
me&mdash;&#8221; the girl said petulantly, but she stepped to the
seat of her chair and vaulted nimbly over the back.
Theodora moved to the vacant place beside her. Lady
Judith and the play went on.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>At the gate, Lary kissed his little sister and sent her
home, going into the house with Mrs. Ascott. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was no need of so much as a nod to assure him that the
evening was not yet finished. She wanted to ask him
about Dr. Schubert&mdash;the tragedy that had mellowed and
sweetened him. But the revelation would come in due
time. Instead, she demanded to know the significance
of Indian Summer. Only that morning the old physician
had remarked&mdash;when she told him of Dutton&#8217;s warning&mdash;&#8220;We
hop from snow to sweat, out here in
Illinois,&#8221;&mdash;that one could endure the heat if one kept
constantly in mind that after frost there would be Indian
Summer.</p>

<p>Indian Summer. She had read a sentimental essay,
years ago.... April&mdash;the arrogant, reckless abundance
of Youth. August&mdash;the passionate heat of Love.
October&mdash;the killing frost of Sorrow. And after that,
the golden peace of Indian Summer. In her part of
the world there was no such division of seasons. Yet
the figures had attached themselves to the walls of her
memory by tenacious tentacles. For her there had been
neither sorrow nor peace ... just the bald monotony
of a life that had been regulated by the artificial standards
of her mother or her husband. She was so deadly
tired of it all. And her work at the laboratory had not
proved absorbing. It was too easy ... the copying of
formulæ and an occasional hand at an experiment that
might be dangerous. But she knew that none of
them would be dangerous. Dr. Schubert was too cautious
to permit her even that zest. Sydney Schubert, the
son, who specialized in diseases of children, she hardly
knew. An epidemic of scarlet fever was raging in the
mining towns of Sutton and Olive Hill, and he was
away from home most of the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to appreciate Syd, you must know the tragedy
of his boyhood,&#8221; Lary began. &#8220;It was more terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
for his parents, of course. But to a sensitive boy who
had an instinctive love of beauty&mdash;quite aside from his
natural devotion to his mother.... Mrs. Schubert was
without doubt the most beautiful woman either of us
had ever seen. Not the type my mother admires. And
it may not have been the kind that would last. She was
too fair and exquisite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she died, while the bloom was still fresh?&#8221;
Judith asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she lived eight years. We never knew how the
thing happened ... a breeze that ruffled her clothing
too close to the grate, or it may have been that her veil
caught fire from an exposed gas flame. She was dressed
to go out, and was waiting for the doctor in the great
hall of their house, when she discovered that her clothing
was ablaze. She wrapped herself in a carriage robe that
happened to be lying on the settle; but she was horribly
burned. One side of her face was disfigured beyond
recognition. Fortunately the eyes were saved. It was
after her recovery that Dr. Schubert had the pipe organ
installed in the hall, to occupy her time, for she never
went out, and at home she always covered her scars with
a veil of white chiffon. Syd and Bob and I took turns
at pumping the organ for her, before the days of electric
motors, and she taught all of us music. One afternoon,
three years ago, they found her at the organ ... her
head resting on the upper manual. They thought at first
she was asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad she went that way,&#8221; Judith said, her throat
tight with emotion.</p>

<p>Lary might have resumed, but he was arrested by
boisterous laughter, out on the street. Eileen and her
friends were going by, and young Marksley was saying,
with a good-natured sneer: &#8220;Cornell&mdash;nix on Cornell for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mine. The kid and I have this college business all doped
out. She&#8217;s going to cut this little Presbyterian joint,
next fall, and we&#8217;re both going to Valparaiso University.
Greatest college on earth! Place where they teach you
to dissolve the insoluble, to transmute the immutable and
unscrew the inscrutable. I&#8217;m going to take commercial
law, and Eileen can go on with her music....&#8221; The
voices died away, as the group turned the corner beyond
Vine Cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish my sister wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; Lary checked himself,
colouring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t take it too seriously. Such school boy
and girl affairs seldom come to anything. Eileen&#8217;s a
stubborn child. I wouldn&#8217;t oppose her ... openly.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>It proved a mistake, letting Eileen go away with Hal
and the others. At midnight she tried to let herself
in noiselessly at the side door, found it unaccountably
locked, and was forced to ring the bell. There was a
scene at the breakfast table, reported to Mrs. Ascott by
Theodora, with dramatic touches. Scenes were not uncommon,
but this one was different. It developed along
unexpected lines. No one had taken into account the
possibility of Mrs. Trench as a bulwark of defence for
Eileen. But that wary ally was not wont to fight in the
open. She was so accustomed to storming the postern
gate, that she was likely to creep around to the rear of
her objective, when the front portal stood open, undefended.
This morning she had for subterfuge the
highly practical business advantage of cultivating Hal
Marksley&#8217;s friendship. Hal&#8217;s father, as the whole town
knew, was preparing to build a palatial mansion in the
parklike addition he had recently laid out, at the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
limit of Springdale&#8217;s residential section. Six architects
had been invited to compete for the plans. It was important
that Larimore Trench be the victor. This
would place the contract for construction automatically
in David&#8217;s hands. But David and Lary wanted to eliminate
themselves from the competition, and admonish
Hal that it would be advisable for him to take his affection
elsewhere. At this, Lavinia forgot her prudence&mdash;delivered
a direct assault on her husband, which might
have been but an echo of the thing she had been saying
to him at regular intervals for twenty-eight years:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;d insult Hal&mdash;spoil Eileen&#8217;s chance, <i>the
way my father spoiled mine</i>&mdash;just because a young man
has money and knows how to show a girl a good time!
I don&#8217;t intend to go through another such experience as
I had with Sylvia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reference to Sylvia was beside the mark. She
had not intended to betray her eagerness for an early
marriage for her second daughter.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IX &nbsp; News From Bromfield</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Lavinia was finding her tenant increasingly useful&mdash;the
wicket gate an open sesame to many of the difficult
problems for which she had been wont to search in vain
the pages of the Self Culture Magazine. A development
watched by her son with incredulous wonder.
Hitherto Lavinia Trench had believed nothing that was
conveyed to her by word of mouth. &#8220;She&#8217;s a pure
visuel,&#8221; Dr. Schubert had sought to explain. &#8220;She gets
her mental concepts through her eyes.&#8221; But Lary knew
that that was not all of it. His mother held an enormous
respect for the printed word. She wanted one of
her sons to be a writer. That would reflect real credit
on the family. Her own inability to form fluid sentences
only increased her admiration for those unseen masters
whose thoughts and experiences had received the accolade
of printer&#8217;s ink. True, she had many times appeared
over her own signature, in the clumsily edited
columns of the Bromfield Sentinel&mdash;when there was a
chance to weave into the story some reference to Larimore&#8217;s
triumphs at Cornell, Sylvia&#8217;s social conquests or
Bob&#8217;s athletic achievements. But to get things published
... and paid for.... This last comment always
sent Lary flying from the room. She would probably
not take any stock in the things he wrote, even if
she read them in print. They were so at variance with
all her established convictions.</p>

<p>On a certain Thursday morning she made occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
call on Mrs. Ascott, the newly arrived copy of the Sentinel
in her hand. Her dark sallow cheeks showed hectic
splotches, and her eyes flared and dimmed with the emotion
she was trying to conceal. She had not written the
story on the front page of the Bromfield paper. Her
fancy&#8217;s most ingenious flight could not have fabricated
anything one half so ... gratifying. So terrible, she
amended, to her own soul. But the real, the usually
submerged Lavinia, knew that the former word was the
right one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the boy, Fournier Stone, that you
used to play with when you were a little girl in Rochester,&#8221;
she began tensely. &#8220;Read that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The story was told with all the crass vulgarity and
offensiveness of small town journalism. The bank examiner
had paid an unexpected visit to the Bromfield
National bank&mdash;because of certain stories that had been
circulated concerning young Stone&#8217;s extravagance in
Rochester and Buffalo. It was found that a large gap between
the bank&#8217;s records and the actual cash on hand had
been bridged by spurious paper that implied the additional
crime of forgery. This, it transpired, was not
Fournier Stone&#8217;s first offence. In the past he had fled
to his mother for assistance; but now Mrs. Stone was
critically ill, and he had not dared to tell her of his
dilemma.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think of a mother shielding her son in such rascality!&#8221;
to which Lavinia added, with snapping satisfaction,
&#8220;But what could you expect of such a mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>The account closed with the statement that Mrs.
Stone had suffered a relapse, because of the shock of
her son&#8217;s arrest, and for several hours her life was despaired
of. The culprit was released, under heavy bond,
and was constantly at his mother&#8217;s bedside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Saturday brought a letter from Ellen Larimore, with
further details. Fournier Stone had disappeared&mdash;walked
out of the house, in the clothes of one of the
servants, right past the secret service man who was there
to trap him. It was thought that he had gone to Canada.
His mother was in a desperate condition. &#8220;Of
course,&#8221; Ellen added, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know a thing for certain.
I talked to Calvin this morning, and the poor man
is distracted. But most people here think he might have
set the boy a better example. I never forgot the day
you told me it was too risky to marry a man who drank
and gambled. What if it was Larimore that was a
fugitive from justice! Aren&#8217;t you thankful that you
married David instead of Calvin? I&#8217;ve had an idea for
a long time that you got wind of the affair with Lettie,
and threw Calvin over, in a jealous huff. Now I see your
wisdom. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you that when they
came to look up Fournier&#8217;s records, in Rochester, it came
out that he is six months older than we thought he was.
There are a lot of things about Calvin Stone&#8217;s marriage
that some of us older people would like to find out about.&#8221;
Lavinia set her teeth hard, and a yellow pallor replaced
the flush of indignant pleasure that had accompanied the
reading of the letter ... up to this point. She had
intended to show the letter to David; but when she came
to the mention of her wisdom in the choice of a husband,
she wavered. That last sentence brought her to
an abrupt decision. She burned the letter&mdash;and repeated
such parts of it as would fit in with a half formed
plan in her own mind.</p>

<p>David was profoundly sorry for the Stones. Their
misfortunes helped to ease the pain in his own heart, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
pain that had never been lulled since the black day when
Bob Trench&#8217;s dripping body was taken from the river. It
was his mother who had urged him to compete for one
more trophy at the annual college field meet. To David it
seemed that his wife cared more for Bob&#8217;s ribbons and
foolish little silver cups than for all Lary&#8217;s scholarships
and medals. He had never connected these spectacular
mementoes with the boastings in the Bromfield Sentinel,
and their possible effect on certain of the old friends,
whose children had not distinguished themselves. Providence,
it now appeared, had been kind in the untimely
taking off of his son. Such disgrace as Fournier Stone
had brought upon his parents would be harder to bear.
In David&#8217;s limited vocabulary respectability had no
place. But principle loomed large. It was the thing
Fournier Stone had done, not the newspaper account of
it, that mattered.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">X &nbsp; Eileen Seeks Counsel</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mrs. Ascott went out into the garden after breakfast
to watch the transfer of tomato plants from the
cold frames beside the garage to the loamy bed that bordered
the west wall. Dutton had explained to her that
nothing would thrive against the high board fence that
shut the grounds from the street, at the east side of the
garden&mdash;on account of the afternoon sun&mdash;and that
these tomatoes would grow six feet high and would disport
their fruit above the stone wall ... if the suckers
were kept picked off. She wondered what suckers were,
and how the afternoon sun had acquired such a sinister
reputation.</p>

<p>She had not slept, and the April air was cool and refreshing.
Mamma and the boys were safely installed in
a Paris apartment. Papa had closed the big house at
Pelham, taking two of the best trained servants with him
to the city establishment on Riverside Drive, and was
happily engrossed in the Wall Street fight for further
millions&mdash;secure from the annoyance of family intrusion.
She had several letters and one cablegram. How remote
it all seemed, how like the hazy memory of another
existence! Two months ago she was trying to
forget Raoul, his amiable as well as his maddeningly offensive
side. Now she seldom thought of him at all.
His personality had lost its definite line and mass. Even
his form was growing nebulous. She could not remember
what it was that he particularly disliked for breakfast
... and whether he was growing alarmingly stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
or thin when he went away to Egypt with Hilda Travers.</p>

<p>It was strange that she should have forgotten. Her
life with him had been made up of just such things as
these. She searched herself for an explanation, as the
gardener rambled on, his words scarce reaching her consciousness.
Slowly the imponderable thoughts assembled
themselves, fashioning for her a shadow picture
of her remote childhood. She was in the old kitchen at
Rochester and her grandmother Holden was baking
cookies for the slum children. There on the marble
slab lay the great mass of yellow dough that so tempted
her eager fingers. More than once she had seized a
breathless opportunity, while grandma&#8217;s back was turned,
to thrust an index finger far down into its golden softness.
And behold! The mass had come together,
leaving scarce a trace of the deep impression she had
made.</p>

<p>Was she as plastic as dough, and had her husband
gone from her life without leaving an impression?
There must be something more ... something that
had not worked out with precision in their case. Did
not that same yielding substance take on the fairly permanent
shapes of lions and camels, dancing girls and
roosters with arching tails? Perhaps Raoul had neglected
to bake the dough. Was she still an impressionable
girl, for all her tragic experience?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The wicket gate opened and Eileen came towards her.
The slim shoulders drooped carelessly and there was
a sullen look about the too voluptuous mouth. Mrs. Ascott
noticed for the first time that Eileen&#8217;s mouth was
like her mother&#8217;s. All the rest of her was, as Theodora
put it, &#8220;pure, unadulterated Trench&#8221; ... excepting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of course, the eyes, which were amber or vicious
yellow, according to her mood. Lary had his father&#8217;s
mouth; but had compromised with his mother on the
question of eyes. Lavinia abhorred compromises, albeit
she had learned to accept them as if they had been of her
own choosing.</p>

<p>The girl stood in rebellious indecision, a few feet from
the tomato bed. Then, as if she had made up her mind
to do the thing ... and take the consequences, she
came swiftly forward, put an arm around Judith&#8217;s waist
and kissed her full on the mouth. It had been so long
since any one had kissed her! The lips were speaking
now, the tone low and vibrant with pleading.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind, do you? If you only knew how I
adore you! I have sat at my window and watched you&mdash;and
wondered about you&mdash;and wanted to kiss you, till
my mouth ached.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thrill went through the woman&#8217;s usually tranquil
body. Here was passion, susceptibility, imagination.
She had not dreamed of such intensity in a girl so young.
And this was the girl Larimore Trench had begged her
to influence, to mould into some shape of his choosing&mdash;a
shape that would be utterly displeasing to her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you come into the house with me? It&#8217;s only a
little after eight. You won&#8217;t be late for chapel if you
start at half-past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no hurry. Hal&#8217;s coming by for me with the
car. He&#8217;ll be on the campus five minutes before he
started, if our old moth-eaten policeman happens to be
looking the other way. I framed up the best looking excuse
for a morning call ... and now I don&#8217;t need
it. You invited me in&mdash;just like that! It&#8217;s always the
way. If I have my gun loaded, there isn&#8217;t any bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think you needed a pretext?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t be sure. And with you ... it&#8217;s too important
to take chances. I&#8217;ve been feeling my way, ever
since you came. I can&#8217;t go dancing in, as Theo does.
She is like mamma. You simply can&#8217;t snub that kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretext was the revelation of the mystery-house
across the way. Hal had told her all about it, after they
left Ina and Kitten and their escorts. The owner of the
carved dragon was Hal&#8217;s sister, Adelaide Nims. There
had been a former marriage, about the time of Hal&#8217;s
birth, a most unsavoury affair. Adelaide was seventeen
at the time, and the reluctant husband was the divorced
partner of one of Henry Marksley&#8217;s affinities. The
Marksleys, père and mère, had been separated three
times. Eileen and Hal agreed that it was indecent for
people who despised each other to live together. Still,
if his parents had not made up that last time, there would
have been no Hal. This would have been calamity for
Eileen.</p>

<p>The present Mrs. Nims was little known in Springdale,
having lived abroad for almost twenty years. Her
first husband, in Eileen&#8217;s piquant phrase, &#8220;had chucked
her&#8221; after a few months&mdash;as a man usually does when
he is dragooned into a distasteful marriage. There had
been other marriages, &#8220;without benefit of clergy,&#8221; the
details of which were suppressed in Springdale. Indeed
coming to light only in connection with a divorce or two
wherein Adelaide had figured as the reprehensible other
woman. She had hair like polished mahogany and melting
brown eyes, a skin like the petals of a Victoria Regia,
at dawn of the morning after the lily&#8217;s opening, before
the sun has tinged its creamy white with the faint rose
that is destined to run the colour gamut to rich purplish
red. She and Syd Schubert vied with each other in the
number of instruments they could play; but she had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
her great success with the &#8217;cello, an instrument whose
playing revealed to the best possible advantage the slim
sensual grace of her body.</p>

<p>It was in a London music hall that Reginald Nims,
younger son of a peer, had fallen beneath the weight of
her manifold charms and had married her&mdash;to the dismay
of his family. Eileen knew what she looked like. Not
from Hal&#8217;s description, but because Springdale had seen
her portrait. Just before she and her husband left
England for China, they had sent it home for safe keeping
... the magnificent portrait that Sargent had
painted. Mrs. Henderson gave a talk on it, in the reading
room of the college library. Red hair, coppery in
the high lights, eyes that would turn an anchorite from
the path of duty, skin texture that was unsurpassed in the
far reach of Sargent&#8217;s marvellous texture painting, a chiffon
gown that reminded you of a cloud of flame-shot
smoke, and a bit of still-life that was definitely, though
not insistently, turquoise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Henderson said that when she read a description
of the picture, she supposed it was going to look like
a Henner; but it was nothing of the sort. I had to go
on the Q. T. to hear her talk. Of course you know,
mamma belongs to the Art Study Club; but she was scandalized
at Mrs. Henderson getting up there and talking
about Adelaide Marksley. Lary tried to make her see
that it was Sargent ... but what&#8217;s the use? You can&#8217;t
get that kind of an idea into my mother&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Browning Club had long since gone the way of
Browning. But Mrs. Henderson, after the death of
her husband, was constrained to seek new means of holding
her grip on the social and intellectual leadership of
the town. Fortunately Mrs. Clarkson, wife of the new
Dean, was not aggressive. She was glad to be enrolled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
along with Mrs. David Trench, as a member of the Art
Study Club. Being a late comer in the town, she knew
no reason why she should withdraw her moral support
from the club, after its shocking display of the Sargent
picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hope the poor girl is at last happily married,&#8221;
Mrs. Ascott hastened to say. She wondered if Eileen
was always quite fair to her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what she isn&#8217;t. And thereby hangs the
tale of their coming here to live for a couple of years.
Hal said his father wanted to rent Vine Cottage for
them&mdash;and in that case they wouldn&#8217;t have brought their
furniture. But your Mr. Ramsay got ahead of him.
I&#8217;m glad he did. But mamma would have turned them
out, lease or no lease, if she ever got her eyes on an
English paper published in Hong Kong, that Hal showed
me, last night. It was the rippingest account you ever
read, of Adelaide&#8217;s elopement with a member of the
military band. It started in a sort of musical flirtation
... and ended in a miserable little hotel in Fu Chau.
The writer said your sympathy would be with Mrs. Nims
if you looked at the shape of Reginald Nims, and remembered
that his wife was fond of dancing. Hal
doesn&#8217;t know what that means&mdash;because he never saw his
brother-in-law. He must be either a cripple or fat. It
won&#8217;t be long till we know. They sail from Honolulu
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she&#8217;s reconciled to her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had to be! She&#8217;s trying to make the best of a bad
mess. The musician soured on his bargain....&#8221;
The amber eyes flamed yellow. &#8220;Left her in the room
at the hotel, and gave her husband the key. How did
he know Nims wouldn&#8217;t kill her? I should think he
would&mdash;if he had any spirit. They&#8217;re coming here till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the scandal blows over and they can go back to London.
Adelaide loathes China, and adores England. Hal said
he guessed that Nims couldn&#8217;t bear to part with a wife
who had red hair, even if he had to do the reversed
Mormon stunt once in a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott experienced a swift revulsion&mdash;not at the
story Eileen was telling. She had heard many such.
But in the bald discussion of sex encounters there lurked
a definite element of danger. For another, and less serious
reason, Hal Marksley ought not to be telling this
story in Springdale, where his sister expected to live.
But Eileen hastened to explain that she alone was in the
secret, and she ... &#8220;was part of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, my dear? I hadn&#8217;t suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Lady Judith, and if you&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;m coming
back after school to tell you what I actually came to tell
you this morning. May I? I&#8217;ll have to chase home
and get my books. Hal&#8217;s honking for me, this minute.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was three o&#8217;clock when Eileen came home from
school, tossed her things on the settee in the living-room
and curled herself up contentedly on a hassock at Mrs.
Ascott&#8217;s feet. Her cheeks were flushed and her low
brow was framed in little caressing ringlets. She looked
amazingly like Lary. Happiness fairly exuded from her
being.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t beat around the bush, Lady Judith. When
I have anything to say ... I have to go to it with both
feet. Will you take care of this for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a shining gold chain from somewhere within
the harbouring crispness of her piqué collar, wound the
pliant links around her slender forefinger, and brought
to light a ring set with a huge diamond. Hal had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it to her that morning. She had known about it for
some time. The stone was one of many that belonged
to his father ... and would never be missed. There
was a good handful of them in a box in the office safe,
and Adelaide would coax them all away from her father.
He, Hal, might as well get his&mdash;while the getting was
good. He had taken this one, and another for a scarf
pin for himself, to St. Louis to be mounted the day after
he and Eileen became engaged.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told your mother?&#8221; Mrs. Ascott interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I can&#8217;t! If you knew mamma better....
It would take all the sacredness&mdash;all the meaning out
of it ... to have mamma preen herself because her
daughter is going to marry the son of the richest man in
town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your father, Eileen?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fair face went gray, and pain quivered the sensitive
lips. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make that as clear as the other; but
I&#8217;m the most unfortunate person in the world. You
don&#8217;t know how I have dreamt of the time when I could
go to my darling old daddy and hide my blushes in his
shoulder, while I told him that the greatest thing in life
had come to me. And now that it&#8217;s come ... he
wouldn&#8217;t understand ... or approve. And mamma,
who hasn&#8217;t a mortal bit of use for me, would take it as
a personal triumph. Rush off to that silly little Bromfield
Sentinel with an announcement of my engagement,
and all about who the Marksleys are, and how much
money they have. I just can&#8217;t give her that gratification.
I&#8217;d choke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sixteen! and she had life&#8217;s irony at her finger ends.
The amber eyes filled with tears that glistened a moment
on the long lashes and went trickling down the pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
checks to make little welts on the stiffly starched piqué
collar. Mrs. Ascott felt no impulse to smile. Here was
a little hurt child, whose quivering lips might have been
pleading for the life of a puppy condemned to be
drowned. And it was all so deadly serious to her.
Love? She might experience a dozen such heart-burnings
before the dawning of the great passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, there is a touchstone given to each one of
us, before we reach the years of discretion and judgment.
Mine was my grandmother. Yours, I believe, is your
father. I hid my engagement to Raoul Ascott from
Grandma Holden. Only because I knew she would not
approve. And, Eileen, my marriage turned out
wretchedly. My husband was much older than I. And,
do you know, dear, the immature mind is keenly flattered
by the attention of the mature one. Hal is a college
senior, almost five years older than you. If you could be
sure your vanity isn&#8217;t involved&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that has nothing to do with it. Hal loves me.
You can&#8217;t understand what that means to me ... because
... you don&#8217;t know how my people regard me.
The only thing I ever wanted is love. Not the kind that
papa gives me. That&#8217;s too general. He loves everything
and everybody&mdash;including my mother, when she
treats him like a dog. But I don&#8217;t want to think about
them, now. It hurts ... to think about my father. I
can stand it, because I&#8217;m not very lovable. He couldn&#8217;t
be unkind if he tried. He would go on loving his children,
if we did the worst thing in the world. I used to
wish Lary would love me ... he&#8217;s so much like papa
in some ways. But you couldn&#8217;t tell anybody that what
you wanted was love. They&#8217;d think you were stalling&mdash;that
you were after something else, and used that for a
blind. Why, even Bob didn&#8217;t really know me&mdash;and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
was the best friend I ever had. I used to steal matches
for him, when he was learning to smoke, and I&#8217;ve taken
many a lickin&#8217; to keep him out of trouble. I got mean
and hateful after he was drowned. Talk about an all-wise
Providence! I couldn&#8217;t have any respect for a God
that would kill Bob and leave me alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Dr. Schubert&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he and Syd....&#8221; Her lips tightened. &#8220;They
wouldn&#8217;t approve of Hal either. He has a reputation
for being ... well, rather loose in his ideas. He isn&#8217;t
a bit worse than the other boys in college. But he happens
not to be the psalm-singing kind. I hate the tight
ideas I was brought up on. But that isn&#8217;t what makes
me love Hal. Lady Judith, if you had been told all your
life that you were ugly and cross and good-for-nothing
... and somebody came along who thought you were
sweet and clever and beautiful&mdash;&#8221; She laughed shortly.
&#8220;Yes, all of that! I know I&#8217;m built according to the
architecture of an ironing board; but Hal says my form
is perfect. He twists my hair around his fingers by
the hour, and he just loves to stroke my cheeks, because
my skin is soft&mdash;like Lary&#8217;s, and papa&#8217;s. Don&#8217;t you
see? Being loved like that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Eileen, I see. How soon are you going to be
married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for years and years. I persuaded Hal, last
night, to go to Pratt Institute, instead of that third rate
college where he was going to take finance. I want him
to do that&mdash;so that Lary&#8217;ll respect him. He doesn&#8217;t intend
to settle down in this dried-up village. He hates it
as much as I do.&#8221; She fell silent a moment.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only one drawback to living away from Springdale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leaving your father?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;No, he wouldn&#8217;t mind that, and neither would I&mdash;after
I had a family of my own. But if one of my children
should get sick&mdash;very sick&mdash;and I couldn&#8217;t reach
Syd&mdash;I&#8217;d be frantic! Syd&#8217;s the only doctor who knows
what&#8217;s the matter with a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love children, Eileen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I adore them.&#8221; She hugged her breast ecstatically.
&#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll have six. Hal loves them, too. That&#8217;s only
one of the tastes we have in common. He wants a
home ... he&#8217;d even be willing to let Lary build it, and
select the furniture. And that&#8217;s a lot ... the way my
brother treats him. I hope you&#8217;ll try to see his fine side,
to like him ... for my sake. You know what it&#8217;s going
to mean to me.&#8221;</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Hal Marksley called regularly in his car to take the
two girls to school. Theo, in the rôle of chaperone, was
novel, to say the least. Occasionally he and Eileen went
for long rides in the country when classes were over.
Once they were delayed by the amusing annoyance of
three punctures, and it was dinner time when they neared
home. Hal took the precaution to leave the roadster
on Grant Drive, traversing the three short blocks to
Elm Street on foot. On other occasions, when there
was no danger of encountering the men-folk of the
family, Mrs. Trench would invite him in for lemonade
and cake, after which she would command Eileen to play
her latest violin piece&mdash;usually a bravura of technique,
quite as incomprehensible to Mrs. Trench&#8217;s accustomed
ears as to Hal&#8217;s&mdash;during which the youth would drum
the window sill with impatient fingers.</p>

<p>It was understood between the young people that Mrs.
Ascott alone was in the secret, and that the engagement
ring had been placed with some of her valuables in Dr.
Schubert&#8217;s vault, against the time when it would be safe
to display it. There was one drop of bitter in Eileen&#8217;s
great happiness. Her father. Even since her talk with
Judith, she had been conscious of something essentially
dishonourable in her conduct. She was beginning to look
at her father with awakened eyes. He had always been
a person of little consequence in his home. Lavinia was
the dynamo that drove the plant. David was a belt or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a fly-wheel, a driving rod or some such nonessential&mdash;easily
replaced if he should break or rust. But David
Trench would never rust. His wife kept him going at
such a rate that a high polish was his only alternative.
Rust gathers on unused metal. Eileen wondered what
her father was like&mdash;inside. What her mother was like,
for that matter. David talked little and Lavinia talked
all the time, and the revelation of silence was, if anything,
more informing than that of incessant chatter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott might win Lary over to a reluctant acceptance
of the engagement; but that would have small
bearing on the problem of her father. It was the way
with pliant natures. You can bend them without in the
least influencing their ultimate resistance. Lavinia might
be shattered by a well directed blow, whereas David
would yield courteous response. There might be a dent
in his feelings, but his convictions would remain as they
were.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>One Friday afternoon, as April lingered tiptoe on
the threshold of May, Dr. Schubert sent for Lary to assist
him with a peculiarly difficult experiment, one calling
for strong nerves and a quick perception. When it was
finished, Lary and Judith walked home together, crossing
the campus to avoid the thoroughfare that connected
the old residence quarter with the fashionable section
that had rooted itself in the once fertile farms of Springdale&#8217;s
newer society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind going a little out of your way?&#8221;
the man asked, consulting his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s early, and I
have a troublesome problem. You know women&mdash;I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An estimate of a possible Mrs. Trench? Take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
advice, Lary. Have her sized up for you by a man&mdash;never
by another woman. Women can&#8217;t be just to each
other when they meet on ... mating ground. Besides,
no woman ever tells a man quite what she thinks of
another woman. The other woman&#8217;s secret is, in part,
her own. She must guard it&mdash;as you guarded the silly
secrets of your college fraternity. If you ever saw the
inside of one of us, you&#8217;d know how little there is to conceal.
But the mystery ... that&#8217;s the important thing.
Still, I&#8217;ll do my best. I&#8217;m old enough to be your mother,
and ought to trust my judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no potential Mrs. Trench in this problem.
The thing that&#8217;s worrying me is the inglenook in a house
I&#8217;m building in Roosevelt Place. The woman&mdash;who has
exceptionally definite ideas of architecture&mdash;has changed
her mind three times. Now she&#8217;s as dissatisfied with her
own planning as she is with mine. We&#8217;re at our
wits&#8217; end, and I must find&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Lary, those birds! They&#8217;re fighting!&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman seized his arm and whirled him about.
They were nearing the end of the campus walk, where
the maples cast slow-dancing shadows on the hard gravel.
Larimore Trench almost lost his footing, as the pebbles
scurried across the grass. He looked at his companion
in astonishment. She was not one to go off her head at
trifles, yet her tone revealed genuine alarm. In the
grass, not ten feet away, two chesty robins were battling
like miniature game cocks, their cries denoting a grotesque
kind of rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;La femme in the case is over there on that syringa,&#8221;
Lary told her, &#8220;estimating the prospects for the posterity
she expects to mother. I have never been satisfied with
the age I have to live in. But I&#8217;m glad I wasn&#8217;t born a
troglodyte, in a world crying for population.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>As he spoke, his back to the street, Hal and Eileen
whisked by in their car and disappeared around the corner.
The two watched the birds a moment. Then they
resumed their walk. The easy confidence that had
grown, quite unnoticed, between them was interrupted.
Strive as they would they could find no common ground.
Judith was vexed with Eileen. Why should she come
along, with her crashing discord, at just that moment?
And again, why did it matter whether she and Larimore
Trench had a pleasant walk or a sullen one? They had
long since discussed every problem under the sun&mdash;and
had found all of them hopelessly old. As they turned
from Grant Drive and were entering Roosevelt Place,
she paused to lay an arresting hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary, there are three houses here under construction.
The one near the middle of the block is yours. You
haven&#8217;t even a bowing acquaintance with the other two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&mdash;not the architect&mdash;flushed with pleasure.
He had never talked shop to Mrs. Ascott, and her recognition
of one of his ideas, simply rendered in rough
concrete and blue-green tile, pleased him. She would
help him to compromise with Mrs. Morton about that
inglenook. But the inglenook was only a subterfuge.
He wanted to talk to her about his sister. She alone
could make Eileen see that her admirer was uncouth, a
good-looking animal devoid of a single quality to survive
the honeymoon.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>As they picked their way cautiously between paint cans
and piles of building refuse, Lary discovered that the
workmen had erected a barricade between the front hall
and the living-room, and the angle of the stairway shut
the chimney corner from view. On the second floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
there was another obstacle. The floors had been newly
waxed, and a stern &#8220;Verboten&#8221; flaunted its impotent arrogance
in their path. They continued their climb to
the third floor, where children, servants, billiards, and
winter garments would be harboured. Judith paused in
the door to the nursery, crossed the room and sank, exhausted,
in the wide window seat. Lary found place
beside her, as he told her of the clever girl who had done
the Peter Pan frieze above the yellow painted wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you fond of children, Lary?&#8221; She was thinking
of Eileen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I detest them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash; But how can you say such a thing? Your
understanding with Theodora is perfect. You kindle,
you glow, when you are telling her stories from the
classics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because she isn&#8217;t a child. I believe she never
was. But my affection for her didn&#8217;t begin when she
was.... The first few months, I believe I hated her.
I may tell you about it some time. When I lose patience
with my mother&mdash;and other women&mdash;I think about that
hideous afternoon, twelve years ago last December. I
don&#8217;t believe any child&mdash;or anything else that men and
women are at such a bother to create and leave behind
them&mdash;is worth all that suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott withdrew, ever so little. She did not
like Larimore Trench when his tone revealed that peculiar
timbre, that quality of boyish cynicism. He had
seen so much of books, so little of life. And then it came
to her that he viewed everything in the sordid world&mdash;the
world outside his imagination&mdash;through the distorting
lenses of his mother&#8217;s personality, her limitations
and her prejudices. In his most violent opposition he
was, nevertheless, directed by her. He would go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
south pole ... because she stood obstinately at the
north. It was she who shaped his course, determined
his stand. Her insistence on the fundamental importance
of material progress drove him early to the post of
disinterested onlooker. That he did his work, and did
it well, was a reflex of his inner nature, the nature that
came to him when David&#8217;s fineness and Lavinia&#8217;s dynamic
ardour were fused, in a moment of unthinking contact.
And it was the penalty of such fusing, that neither
of his parents comprehended the nature they had given
him.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The silence towered, opaque and forbidding, between
them. But they had come with a purpose, groping their
way to the same objective, neither one guessing what was
in the other&#8217;s mind. By a devious path, that was nevertheless
essentially feminine, Judith approached:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary, do you want to tell me about your brother?
It would have made such a difference in Eileen&#8217;s life&mdash;if
he had lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have enjoyed Bob&mdash;a tremendous fellow,
every phase of him. He played half-back on the college
team when he was sixteen. And at that, he took the
state cup in the half mile dash. He had medals for hammer
throwing and pole vault. There is a whole case of
his cups and ribbons in the college library. He&#8217;s the
only one of us who inherited my mother&#8217;s energy. Oh,
Sylvia, of course. She can rattle around and make a
great showing&mdash;and she does actually accomplish things
when she has a definite purpose ... something she
wants to do. The rest of us are a listless pack. We&#8217;d
rather climb a tree and watch the parade go by. But
Bob was in everything, for the sheer fun of living. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
looks to me like a stupid blunder ... to cut off such
virility before it had perpetuated itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen told me she had lost her respect for God,
since her brother was drowned. She was so naïve and
in such deadly earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen was a born doubter. I was sixteen when I
revolted against the idea of a Deity with the duties of an
ordinary stockroom clerk&mdash;and it was one of Eileen&#8217;s
searching questions that set me thinking. Not bad for
six years old. Mamma holds to the old orthodox belief
as one of the hallmarks of respectability. In her day,
and town, the iconoclasts were pool-room keepers and
saloon bums. The catechism was drilled into us as soon
as we could talk. My mother would have been a great
ritualist, if she had had the luck to be born an Anglican.
There isn&#8217;t much in her church to hang your hat on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father, Lary&mdash;religion means something to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... it&#8217;s about all he has. Eileen breaks his
heart with her irreverent flings. I spare him. Not
because I am more considerate than she. More selfish,
perhaps. I can&#8217;t take the consequences of inflicting pain.
You&#8217;ll call it crass spiritual weakness&mdash;a flaw in the casting.
I&#8217;ve tried to overcome it. I couldn&#8217;t have endured....&#8221;
His voice wavered, &#8220;Last night I heard
my father praying for Eileen. It was ghastly. I
wanted to tell her how she is torturing him. But it
would only provoke a fresh outburst of scoffing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary, will you give Eileen into my hands&mdash;stop
worrying about her&mdash;you and your father? Will you
persuade him that I have been sent &#8216;from on high&#8217; to
guide her through this wilderness? I may fail; but I have
her confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa was afraid, because you were rich, that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
would share her mother&#8217;s view. Oh, not that Eileen
took refuge in your sympathy. She&#8217;s too proud, too
good a sport, for that. She only told him that money,
<i>per se</i>, was no obstacle&mdash;<i>vide</i> Mrs. Ascott. Before
she was through with it, she told him that if he kept on,
she would go to the devil with Hal Marksley. It was
after that that he carried his trouble to the God who is
said to answer prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a substitute for the Deity.... But at least,
Lary, I know the premises. And at the worst, it is only
the working out of her own nature. No one can live
Eileen&#8217;s life for her, not even her father. But there&#8217;s
the tower clock, striking six. You will be late for dinner&mdash;and
we haven&#8217;t looked at that inglenook.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XII &nbsp; The Poem Judith Read</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>From her vine-screened retreat in the summer house,
Judith Ascott looked out on the fairest May Day she
had ever known. It was the morning after ... and
the promise she had made to Lary hung sinister and foreboding
over her spirit. Everything around her was
vibrant with coming summer. At home the buds would
be opening timorously, while here the perennial climbers
were in full leaf. An aureate splendour, seductive as
Danae&#8217;s rain, rippled through the open structure of the
pergola, transmuting the pebble walk to a pavement of
costly gems; but within the widening of the arbour&mdash;that
David had converted into an outdoor living-room&mdash;the
frightened shadows sought refuge from the shafts
that would presently destroy them. To the cool umbrageous
corner nearest the house, where the light was faint,
the woman had taken her world-weary body, yearning
for the relaxation her bed had denied her.</p>

<p>It was all so insistent, this new life that had come to
her, its music keyed to a pitch she had never realized, a
tempo beyond the reach of her experience. The
Trenches. Were there other families in the universe like
this one? Before her coming to Springdale she had
viewed the world through a thick forest of people, most
of them intolerably tiresome. In the main they were
contented ... such contentment as is to be derived
from a favourable turn in the market or the balm of
Bermuda to beguile a winter&#8217;s day. Happy lives, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had read, make uninteresting biographies. Her life had
been far from happy, and her biography would be utterly
stupid. Mrs. Trench was&mdash;she realized with a stab of
astonishment&mdash;a desperately unhappy woman, and her
life story was made up of a propitious marriage and six
abnormally interesting children. And then ... Theo
appeared at the other side of the garden wall, discerned
the white-clad figure among the verdant shadows of the
summer house, and scaled the low barrier with the nimbleness
of a squirrel. In the folds of her skirt she held
something, and a furtive air pervaded her small person.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Judith, may I have the honour of a morning
call?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do come, you little ray of sunshine. Your Lady Judith&#8217;s
sky is overcast, and she is in sore need of cheer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go bothering Mrs. Ascott this morning,&#8221;
Theo&#8217;s mother cried sharply from the pantry window.
&#8220;You ought to know enough not to wear out your welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger,&#8221; Judith assured her. She did not perceive
the look of sharp displeasure on the older woman&#8217;s
face, but the voice affected her disagreeably, and she
turned for relief to the anomalous reproduction of Lavinia,
who was already nestling confidently at her side,
on the oaken settle. The child spread upon her knee
two sheets of paper, on which many lines had been written.
A casual glance betrayed the agony of composition.
Words had been discarded by the device of an impatient
pen stroke. Others had been consigned to oblivion
by means of carefully drawn lines. Phrases had
been transposed and rhyming terminals changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a poem. I thought it would help to cheer you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
up. Mamma wouldn&#8217;t like it, and neither would Mrs.
Stevens&mdash;because it doesn&#8217;t hop along on nice little iambic
feet. It has to say &#8216;te-tum, te-tum, te-tum,&#8217; or they
think it isn&#8217;t poetry. Eileen writes some that are wilder
than this one; but she never lets mamma see them. She
wrote one on Love, last Sunday morning, when she ought
to have been listening to the sermon, and ... what
do you think! Left it in the hymn book! And Kitten
Henderson found it, and sent it to Dan Vincel as her own
composition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott took the copy, scanning the first page
with crescent interest. She had not thought of Eileen as
a poet. Yet such intense musical feeling.... The
musician is seldom a poet of marked quality or distinction.
The godlike gifts of rhythm, cadence, imagery,
these may not flow with equal volume in double channels.
Yet the verses, however crude, would shed another light
on a nature too complex for ready analysis. There was
no title, no clue to the impulse that promoted the writing.
There was no need of such. A girl in Eileen&#8217;s
rhapsodic mental state would not go far in search of
inspiration.</p>

<p>Theo sat breathless, a flush of expectation staining her
dark skin, as the first page was laid aside and the second
came to view. Before the remaining stanzas were finished,
her heart was beating visibly through the thin
morning dress, as her lips fashioned soundlessly the lines
she had memorized at the second reading:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Theodora, are you <i>sure</i> that Eileen wrote these
verses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen? Goodness, no! She scrawls all over the
paper. You never saw her write a neat little hand like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who did write it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ... Lary, of course. I thought you knew
he was the poet&mdash;the <i>real</i> poet of the family. He wrote
it last night. I saw his light burning at four o&#8217;clock
this morning. I couldn&#8217;t sleep, either. Mine was ear-ache.
His was another kind. He says you always have
to agonize when you write anything worth while. And I
think this poem is ... worth while ... don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The solid ground of assurance was, somehow, slipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from beneath her feet. Lady Judith was not
pleased. Her usually pale cheeks burned red, and there
was an unfamiliar look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen told you to bring this to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d show her Lary&#8217;s
poem? He lets me see lots of things he writes, that
mamma and the rest of them don&#8217;t know anything about&mdash;till
they&#8217;re published. And if the stupid editors send
them back&mdash;I never do tell. I wouldn&#8217;t ... for the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave you this to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-n-not exactly. He left the desk unlocked. Didn&#8217;t
put the top quite all the way down, and one corner of
the paper was sticking out. I had to see what it was,
so that if it was something the others oughtn&#8217;t to see,
I could put it under the blotter, out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>An expression of Dutton&#8217;s flashed through Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s
mind: &#8220;Theo&#8217;s the spit of her mother. She&#8217;ll do
the dirtiest tricks, and explain &#8217;em on high moral
grounds.&#8221; She caught and held the dark, troubled eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodora, do you know that you have done something
almost unpardonable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lady Judith, when anybody feels the way Lary
does, and you love him as much as I do&mdash;don&#8217;t you see,
the sooner there&#8217;s an understanding, the better? It was
that way with the Lady Judith in the story. And if it
hadn&#8217;t been for the meddlesome fairy, that found the
drawing of the two hearts, interlocked, the Prince
wouldn&#8217;t have known, till it was too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theo,&#8221; the woman interrupted sharply, &#8220;take these
two sheets of paper back to your brother&#8217;s room, and lay
them exactly as you found them, so that he won&#8217;t know
they have been moved or seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fear puckered the thin little face, fear and chagrin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
With sparrow-like motion she turned and darted in the
direction of the wicket gate. Midway she stopped, arrested
by the timbre of Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s voice&mdash;a sternness
she had not deemed possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back, Theodora, if you want me ever to care
for you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment the lithe body wavered, the mind irresolute.
Then she set her head impishly on one side, looked at
the angry, frightened woman with a scold-me-if-you-can
expression, and slowly retraced her steps, dragging her
toes in the gravel and swaying her straight hips from
side to side. It was pure bravado. At the entrance to
the summer house, her spirit broke. In another instant
she was in Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s lap and great sobs were shaking
her agitated bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, precious, I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you. But,
can&#8217;t you realize, dearie? You must be made to realize,
no matter how it hurts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are the one who must be made to realize. I
knew it, all along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knew what, Theo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Lary&#8217;s crazy about you. He never cared for
anybody&mdash;not even puppy-dog love, when he was a boy.
He was glad when Sylvia married, so he wouldn&#8217;t have to
take her girl friends home&mdash;when they hung around
so late that they were afraid to go home by themselves.
I&#8217;ve been waiting to tell you about him for ever so long.
You couldn&#8217;t know how good he is&mdash;how good&mdash;and
wonderful.&#8221; The smothered voice was full of adoration.
&#8220;He has the dearest ways, when you are all alone
with him. And he never misses the point of a joke.
Mamma can say witty things; but she almost never sees
the other fellow&#8217;s joke. And his hands are so gentle&mdash;not
strong and rough, like Bob&#8217;s. If you only knew....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
But Lary wouldn&#8217;t ever tell you the nice side of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hungry arms pressed her close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; the advocate stopped her pleading, to sigh with
infinite relief. &#8220;You won&#8217;t be angry with me. But,
Lady Judith, I had to do it ... if you hadn&#8217;t ever forgiven
me. Lary is teaching me to stand things like a
stoic. And when so much depends on it&mdash;&#8221; The eyes
flamed with an idea. &#8220;You know, like walking along in
the dark, and all at once somebody strikes a match to
light a cigar, and you see that there is a hole in the road
that you would have fallen into. If no one had struck a
match, how would you know the hole was there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can keep this secret&mdash;never let your brother
suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the last person in the world that I&#8217;d tell. He&#8217;d
be more angry than you were. And there&#8217;s another
reason. I&#8217;m not quite sure that Lary knows what&#8217;s the
matter with him. Of course he says&mdash;in the last stanza
of the poem. He&#8217;s written love poetry before, when it
was only a woman he imagined, and so he might not
think it was serious. Mrs. Ferguson said that if her
husband had suspected that he was falling in love with
her, he would have taken the first train out of town.
Afterward ... he was glad he didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Theodora! Are you sixty years old, and have you
settled the marriage problems of a dozen unpromising
daughters and granddaughters? Where did you get
such ideas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard mamma and Mrs. Ferguson talking about it,
before Sylvia was married. I never forget anything I
hear; but it&#8217;s an awful long time before I get light on
some things. When I read Lary&#8217;s poem, this morning&mdash;and
came to that last line&mdash;and remembered how pale
you looked when you came out in the yard before breakfast&mdash;why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
all at once the ideas came tumbling together,
and I knew that Lary mustn&#8217;t know he was in love till
he was so far in, he wouldn&#8217;t want to ever get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was adorable, the way she took Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s attitude
and response for granted. No woman, not even
the enshrined Lady Judith, would fail to be honoured by
Lary&#8217;s love.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>&#8220;Theo-<i>do</i>-ra!&#8221; Drusilla&#8217;s broad cadence issued from
the pantry window. Drusilla was the coffee-coloured
maid of all work, who was serving temporarily as mouthpiece
for Mrs. Trench. &#8220;Come home this minute,
honey. You got to do an errand befoh lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theodora reflected that there was time for twenty
such errands. And her perplexity grew when, after a
few minutes, she saw Eileen pass through the wicket gate
to take Mrs. Ascott an embroidery pattern from an old
number of the Self Culture magazine. She remembered
distinctly that Mrs. Ascott had said she did not care particularly
about it. That was a week ago. Why had
mamma dragged it out now, and sent it over by Eileen?</p>

<p>With all her wizard penetration, the child had never
glimpsed the deep windings of her mother&#8217;s mind. Mrs.
Ascott could not be counted on to take a lively interest in
two of the Trench children, and for the present Eileen
was the focal point of her mother&#8217;s concern. More and
more the conviction grew that this woman from the great
outside world had been sent by Divine Providence to
aid in bringing to swift climax what otherwise might
have been a long drawn out affair.</p>

<p>Long engagements were dangerous. Sylvia had been
engaged to Tom Henderson for two years. If she, Lavinia
Larimore, had listened to Calvin, when he begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
her to run away and be married, the night he proposed
to her.... It was when she reached this stage in her
silent soliloquy that she determined to have Drusilla call
Theodora home, and send Eileen to Vine Cottage in her
stead.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">XIII &nbsp; Eyes Turned Homeward</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It is improbable that Bromfield&#8217;s weekly paper would
have yielded its meagre space for the chronicling of Eileen
Trench&#8217;s engagement, had that important fact been
divulged at home. There were other, more momentous
things going on. The entire front page of each issue
was plastered with the Stone sensation, which grew by
melodramatic leaps to something like an international
affair. Fournier Stone had been captured in Montreal,
had broken from his captor and leaped into the river.
At first it was thought that he had been drowned; but he
was an agile swimmer, and it was reported that a man answering
his description had been seen near Longueuil,
an hour or two after his escape.</p>

<p>From Mrs. Stone&#8217;s darkened bedroom came bulletins
of one collapse after another. The news that her darling
had perished in the treacherous waters beneath the Victoria
bridge affected her so profoundly that the physician
resorted to nitroglycerine injections to restore her.
Lavinia read the accounts with emotions that surged
from exultation to a species of envy. The part she had
been called upon to play was such a drab one, that Lettie
Stone&#8217;s colourful rôle stung her. To ease her mind, she
fell back on one passage of Scripture after another. She
might have known all along that the marriage would
end in something like this. It was right that it should
end this way ... right that an immoral, unprincipled
woman should suffer. And Calvin? No doubt he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
suffering, too. But what was the good of going over
that ground&mdash;ground that she had long since stripped
bare of every sprig of comfort or misery?</p>

<p>At last came the startling denouement. Mrs. Calvin
Stone was dead. There had been a simple private funeral&mdash;attended
by everybody in Bromfield. That night
Fournier had slipped stealthily into town, and out to the
cemetery, where he had ended his life on his mother&#8217;s
grave. The account of the double tragedy was not news
to Lavinia. Ellen Larimore had sent a telegram ...
just why, it was difficult to explain. The message came
Sunday morning, while David and the girls were at
church and Lary was at the office getting out some rush
specifications. It conveyed only the bare information
that Fournier Stone had shot himself, the night after his
mother&#8217;s funeral.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead ... Calvin free!&#8221; the woman muttered, staring
in a daze at the words. And, after a moment of
strangling emotion: &#8220;But what difference does it make&mdash;now?
I can&#8217;t be there to see it. I wouldn&#8217;t go, <i>if</i> I
<i>could</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture Lavinia&#8217;s thoughts took an unexpected
turn. She was always thinking things she had no intention
of harbouring within her consciousness&mdash;as if she
had a whole cellar full of ideas she did not know she possessed.
The one that came up to her now nauseated her.
To see Calvin weeping over the body of his dead wife!
Oh, the insolent superiority of the dead! You have no
words with which to confront them. All their failings,
all their sins are lifted above your most virtuous attack.
It would be like this if David should die, and she could
no longer upbraid him. No, it was better for people to
go on living. You could at least speak your mind, without
galling self-reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Lavinia was determined to put Calvin Stone definitely
and permanently from her thought. He had been amply
punished for his monstrous treatment of her. The incident
was closed, and at last she could have peace. And
then something came to divert all her thinking into a
channel that must have been present in the dark valley
of her being all the while&mdash;unrecognized, because the
need for it had been so hazily remote. A story&mdash;one of
Larimore&#8217;s foolish stories. She seldom listened to
them; but this one she could not escape. Eileen had
gone home with Hal Marksley and had met his sister.
It was Wednesday, and the outcome of the Stone imbroglio
was still locked in her heart, the telegram having
been burned in the kitchen range, Sunday morning, while
Drusilla was on the second floor, doing up the bedrooms.</p>

<p>After dinner the Trench family had gravitated, one by
one, to Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s summer house. David was there,
laughing boyishly at something Eileen was telling.
What were they talking about? Lavinia&#8217;s sharp ears
caught a sentence now and then. It was not her wont to
be out of things, the things that concerned her family.
Her tenant seldom invited her&mdash;specifically. But then
she never invited Mrs. Ascott, either. Going to the
pantry, she filled a plate with raisin muffins, from the
afternoon&#8217;s baking. Eileen would approach that shrine,
armed with a sensational story; but her mother carried
breakfast rolls.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>When Nanny had taken the plate into the house, Judith
made room for Mrs. Trench on the settle at her
side. David leaned against the solid beam that he had
set, seven years ago, to support the arch of the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
His blue eyes were full of unwonted content. Theodora
was perched on the afternoon tea table, folded now
to look like a packing case, steadying herself by a brown
hand on her father&#8217;s arm. Eileen was on the other
bench with Lary. She resumed the narrative that had
been interrupted by her mother&#8217;s arrival:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s the most unspeakable beast I ever saw.
Oh, by-the-way, mamma, I was telling them about meeting
Mr. and Mrs. Nims, this afternoon. Kitten and
Hal and I had to go over to the house to get some rugs
and things for the play, in the college chapel, and
Adelaide opened the door for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash; How did she treat you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right. She didn&#8217;t know me from anybody
else.... But she&#8217;s coming to help coach us, the night
of dress rehearsal. Mrs. Henderson said, in her talk,
that most of the charm in that Sargent portrait was the
technique&mdash;brush work and colour arrangement. But
Adelaide Nims doesn&#8217;t need Johnny Sargent or any other
artist to tell her how to colour up. She had on an embroidered
Chinese robe&mdash;the kind the Mandarin women
wear in the house&mdash;pinkish tan, with a wide band of blue
around the sleeves and neck&mdash;the kind of blue that fairly
made her hair flame. I wanted to eat her, she was so
beautiful. And just then I got a glimpse of her husband,
through the window. He was sprawled all over a lawn
bench that was built to hold three decent-sized people,
and his stomach came out like the side of the rain barrel.
I was trying to get a good look at his face, when he began
to yawn&mdash;you know, the kind of a yawn that ate up
all the rest of his features. I wanted to giggle ... or
scream! And when he finally came into the house, and
Kitten and I met him, I couldn&#8217;t think of a thing but that
awful cavern inside his mouth. Gee! I&#8217;d hate to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to live with a man who looks like a hogshead, split down
the middle, and an Edam cheese for a head&mdash;and no neck
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose the nobility looked like that,&#8221; Mrs.
Trench snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! He&#8217;s only a younger son&mdash;and nine brothers
and nephews between him and a handle to his name.
Adelaide must have been in an awful tight pinch to have
married him, money or no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may not have been so stout when he courted her,&#8221;
David ventured. &#8220;When your mother married me, no
one would have thought of calling me her &#8216;better three-quarters&#8217;&mdash;and
look at us now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Other</i> three-quarters,&#8221; Lavinia corrected. &#8220;I never
could see the justice in calling a man his wife&#8217;s &#8216;better&#8217;
half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s historical warrant for your objection,
mamma,&#8221; Lary said, hoping to avert the revelation his
mother was all too prone to make&mdash;her callous contempt
for David in particular and men as a class.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean the tiresome old story of Adam and
the rib,&#8221; Eileen demurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that. I found the story in some elective
Greek we were reading, my third year in college. And
as you describe this Mr. Nims, he seems to fit the original
model. Seven of us were selected to translate the Symposium
of Plato, and I had the story Aristophanes was
said to have told at that memorable banquet. It was in
response to the toast, &#8216;The Origin of Love.&#8217; As the
gods planned the world, there was no such thing as love.
But they had created a race of terribly efficient mortals&mdash;hermaphroditic
beings, man and woman in one body,
their faces looking in opposite directions. They had
four legs and a double pair of arms, and when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wanted to go somewhere in a hurry, they rolled over and
over, like an exaggerated cart wheel, touching all their
hands and feet to the ground in succession. They could
see what was going on behind them, and could throw
missiles in two directions at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as they didn&#8217;t realize their advantage, it
was all right. But one day a leader was born among
them. I suspect it was the female half of him who discovered
that they were superior to the gods. If they
went about it right, they could capture Olympus, and send
the gods to earth to toil and offer sacrifices. The one
thing the gods cared about was having their vanity fed,
by the smoke from countless altars. It was for this
service that man was created, in the beginning. So,
when it was reported on Mount Olympus that mortals
aspired to be gods, Zeus conceived a way to avert the disaster,
and at the same time have twice as many creatures
on earth to offer sacrifices.</p>

<p>&#8220;He made a great feast, and invited all the insolent
race of man. And when he had them at his mercy, so
that they couldn&#8217;t escape, he had them brought to him,
one at a time, and cleft them in two, vertically, so
that they could look only in one direction, and run on
only two feet&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O-wee-woo!&#8221; Theodora squirmed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t they
bleed ... terribly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Theo, it&#8217;s only a story,&#8221; Mrs. Trench exclaimed,
irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s how a man and his other half came to be
separated,&#8221; David said, drawing Theodora to him and
stroking her pain-puckered brow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the gods thought they had destroyed man, when
they cleft him in two,&#8221; Lary went on, his brown eyes
shining. &#8220;But in that act of ruthlessness they sowed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
seeds of their own destruction. When they hurled the
mutilated creatures out of Paradise, most of the halves
became separated. Then began the endless search for
their other halves. The men realized that they couldn&#8217;t
live up to their full capacity, with the feminine side of
themselves gone. And when they did find each other,
they experienced a rapture that surpassed the highest
emotional possibility of the immortals. That thrill was
love. The gods heard about it, and condescended to
mate with mortals, in the hope of experiencing the thrill.
But it was useless. They had not been separated from
their other halves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did they sow the seeds of their own destruction?&#8221;
Judith asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old story of the apple in the Garden of Eden.
The thing they couldn&#8217;t get became the ultimate desideratum.
They devoted all their energy to the quest of love.
They deserted all their old godlike pursuits&mdash;and in the
end, the Greek deities crumbled and were destroyed by
the more vigorous gods of the barbarians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Theodora pondered the tale. She could not be satisfied
by the application to Mr. and Mrs. Nims. The tub-like
man, who was far more tublike in her imagination
than Eileen&#8217;s exaggerated description should have warranted,
was undoubtedly the man who was married to
Hal&#8217;s sister. But Mrs. Nims was thin. And he was
her second husband. Manifestly something was wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Lary, suppose when those men tried to find their
other halves, they couldn&#8217;t.... Their right halves had
died, or had got tired of waiting and had gone off with
some one else....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be any thrill of love, and the man
couldn&#8217;t do his best, because he lacked the right person
to urge him on,&#8221; David told her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; this from Eileen, &#8220;I guess the woman
would be in as bad a fix as the man. Poor Adelaide
Nims has had two tries at her other half, and missed it
both times. She&#8217;s terribly unhappy, for all that she puts
up such a good front. Lady Judith, don&#8217;t you think she
ought to keep on trying till she does find the right one?
Or is there a right one for all of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... unless we rush off into an alliance that prevents
us from recognizing our true mate,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott
said pointedly.</p>

<p>The girl flushed. The shaft had gone home. She
shifted her gaze from the clear gray eyes ... and surprised
an inexplicable expression on her mother&#8217;s face.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Lavinia had listened, without interest, to the story.
But the application&mdash;she had been brought up on stories
with a Moral at the end. &#8220;Unless we rush off into an
alliance....&#8221; Her face grew hard, a yellow pallor
spreading from neck to brow. That was what she had
done. That was what Calvin had done. It was his
fault, not hers, that she had erred. She ignored the
years of waiting, before Calvin had known Lettie. And
those two had been mismated, had lived apart most of
the time, the first few years of their married life, had
quarreled violently when they were together. There
must have been a right partner for Calvin. She choked
with emotion as she realized&mdash;she had never been sure
of it, in all those years&mdash;that Lettie was not the right
one. She would like to see Calvin Stone again, now that
it was all over. But what was the use? There was
David, forty-eight, and ridiculously healthy. That night
she lay awake, into the gray of dawn, thinking, thinking....</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIV &nbsp; A Broken Axle</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Late Thursday afternoon Mrs. Trench crossed the
lawn with tottering steps. She looked incredibly old, with
the bloodless lips and the greenish pallor of her sunken
cheeks. &#8220;No wonder her children are temperamental,&#8221;
Judith thought, remembering the crispness of her step
and the full flush of her dark skin as she crossed that
same stretch of grass the previous evening, the plate of
rolls in her hand. She came now with no offering of good
will. There was set purpose in her eyes. And her
mouth ... Judith wondered how she could have
thought Eileen&#8217;s mouth looked like that. A sleepless
night and the bald revelation of Calvin Stone&#8217;s sorrow&mdash;discussed
at the luncheon table as the Bromfield paper
was handed about&mdash;had reduced her resistive power to
its lowest point. When her life stream was full, she had
little difficulty concealing the slimy bed of her being.
But now, with all her animation ebbed away, she groped
within her own turbid depths, blinded by resentment and
self-pity until even prudence forsook her. In any other
state of mind, she would not have flung down the gauntlet
to the one woman on whom she must depend for the
furthering of her plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott, would you mind going inside? I can&#8217;t
stand this sunshine. I never could see why David put
a door in the west side of this summer house, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
afternoon sun can shine right in your face. But David
always bungles things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill. I am so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. I&#8217;ll be myself after I&#8217;ve had a night&#8217;s
rest. The fact is, I want to have a plain talk with you.&#8221;
Judith led the way to the library. With rigid lips, that
marred her usual sharp enunciation, she began bluntly.
&#8220;I feel that it&#8217;s my Christian duty to tell you some nasty
truths about that Mrs. Nims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Village gossip. I&#8217;m sure, Mrs. Trench, I&#8217;m not in
the least interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>An ugly purplish red crept along Lavinia&#8217;s corded
neck and up over the cheeks to the line of straight black
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you and Eileen are planning all sorts of intimacy&mdash;musical
trio with you at the piano, playing accompaniments
for the violin and &#8217;cello&mdash;and Larimore and his
father are terribly vexed. Of course you couldn&#8217;t be
expected to know anything about the woman ... being
a newcomer in the town. And you couldn&#8217;t know how
important it is to me, right now, not to have my husband
displeased.&#8221;</p>

<p>It transpired that Eileen had talked too much, at breakfast,
that morning ... too many details of her call at
the Marksleys&#8217; home, the play the Dramatic Club was
putting on, for the benefit of the laboratory fund, in
which Hal Marksley had to kiss her, beneath the pale
glow of a marvellously devised stage moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trio was only a tentative suggestion. If Mr.
Trench&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much his opposition as Larimore&#8217;s. He
never had any use for the Marksley family&mdash;and this big
competition coming on. Villa residence, keeper&#8217;s lodge,
garage and barns. It will mean a great deal to my son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to win that commission. And the contract for the construction
will be the biggest thing Mr. Trench has had
since he put up the new Science Hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think being kind to Mrs. Nims would be a
help rather than a hindrance,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott said, perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would, if I had reasonable men to deal with. The
fact is&mdash;if I <i>must</i> speak plainly&mdash;young Mr. Marksley is
very much in love with Eileen. I wouldn&#8217;t have anything
come between them for the world. You are a married
woman. You ought to know Eileen&#8217;s type. She isn&#8217;t
the least bit like me. If she resembles any of my family,
it is my sister Isabel&mdash;and we were thankful to get her
safely married at seventeen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Marksley, they told me, is going to Pratt
when he is graduated from the college, here. It will be
four or five years before&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more of Eileen&#8217;s foolishness. What use has he
for more education&mdash;with all that money? And she
knows as well as I do that he can go into business with
his brother Alfred, in St. Louis, the day after commencement.
He doesn&#8217;t have to depend on his father, who
detests him. I suppose Eileen has told you that fact,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Ascott shook her head, irritation mounting to
anger, as her caller&#8217;s tone divested itself of that modicum
of reserve that had been the inculcated habit of years.
In all her experience she had never met a woman like
Lavinia Trench. From their second meeting, there had
been an undercurrent of hostility, which Lavinia was at
great pains to subdue or conceal. A rich woman was a
person to be envied ... and conciliated. In her normal
state she would not have jeopardized the fragile
bond of surface friendship that bound them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Not that the interview reached the disgusting level of
a quarrel. Yet Judith was betrayed into the fatal error
of attempting to reason with a woman whose mental
processes had never recognized the inevitable link between
cause and effect. She did not know how to deal with the
mind that leaped from one vantage point to another, with
all the nimbleness and none of the objectivity of a circus
acrobat. Dutton had once said of Mrs. Trench: &#8220;You
can&#8217;t nail that woman down. When you trap her
square, on her own proposition&mdash;she&#8217;s over yonder, on
an entirely different subject, crowing over you. If she
can&#8217;t make her point, she talks about something else.&#8221;
But Judith gave little heed to Dutton&#8217;s mumblings.</p>

<p>The one thing Mrs. Trench had made unequivocally
plain was that Larimore and his father must not be antagonized.
This could be accomplished only by keeping
Eileen&#8217;s fondness for Hal in the background, and avoiding
any public contact with his highly immoral sister. It
was in connection with Mrs. Nims that Judith blundered.
She could not believe that either David or Larimore
Trench would cast a stone at the woman who had sinned
and was unhappy because of her sin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Mary Magdalene, and all that? Well, I
don&#8217;t believe Christ expects <i>me</i> to associate with the
woman who ran away from two husbands&mdash;travelled with
the first one for three weeks before they were married at
all. There&#8217;s no reforming a woman like Adelaide
Marksley. She&#8217;s bad, through and through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may have been extenuating circumstances.
What do you and I know about her inside life? Until we
have been tempted, as she was, we have no moral right to
set up our code&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8220;You think I have never been tempted? I could tell
you a story ... if I was a-mind to. It was only my
sense of honour and duty. And that ought to be enough
for Adelaide Nims or any other woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may not have had a very clear conception of the
meaning of &#8216;honour&#8217; and &#8216;duty.&#8217; Do you think those
terms mean the same thing to all women? Do they mean
the same thing to any woman, at all times? You don&#8217;t
know anything about the inner life of the girl who grows
up in a loveless home, or is trapped in a childless home of
her own, with a man who doesn&#8217;t love her. Your life
has been crowded with responsibility and affection. You
have a husband whose devotion to you is the most
beautiful&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think David is a paragon. You haven&#8217;t had to
live with him for almost twenty-eight years. You haven&#8217;t
had to drive him, every step he took, for fear he would
sit down on you, and let the family starve. And as for
the children ... what has that got to do with it?
Why&mdash;it was when Isabel was so sick that&mdash;that the minister
kept calling and calling. All the women in the
church were crazy about him. I never dreamt he was in
love with me till the night before the baby died. But I
showed him his place, quick enough, when he told me he
could see that David didn&#8217;t understand or appreciate
me.&#8221; Her eyes gleamed with pride, as if she would have
gloated: &#8220;There! You didn&#8217;t know I had been tempted&mdash;and
by the minister, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, Mrs. Trench, you can&#8217;t draw the line
between the woman who sins and the one who is saved
from sinning by some fortuitous accident. Your baby
died, the next day. If she had lived ... and you had
seized the chance for the happiness you had missed, I
would have no condemnation for you. I know. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
almost in sight of that treacherous snare&mdash;when the axle
of our motor car broke, and my father overtook us and&mdash;brought
me to my senses. We were within a mile of
the pier where his yacht was anchored&mdash;the man who was
as unhappy in his loveless home as I was in mine. We
were going to Italy, to hunt for what we both had missed.
My husband had gone to Egypt with another woman. I
told myself that my marriage vow was an empty mockery....&#8221;
She stopped, a sickening wave of self-disgust
overwhelming her. Why had she bared her soul to
this woman?</p>

<p>Lavinia? She made no effort to conceal her horror.
So this was why Mrs. Ascott did not wear mourning!</p>

<p>&#8220;And he, your husband&mdash;divorced you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I divorced him. In New York there is only one
cause for divorce, and in the eyes of the law, I had committed
no offence. Mrs. Nims, with her bringing up&mdash;with
the family environment that surrounds her and her
brother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, with men it is different. You don&#8217;t expect morality
in them. David says that Hal is fast. That&#8217;s at
the bottom of the whole trouble. I wish I hadn&#8217;t said
anything about the affair. I might have known you
wouldn&#8217;t see it as I do. But then, I hadn&#8217;t suspected&mdash;&#8221;
She checked herself. There were some things
Lavinia wouldn&#8217;t say, even when she was indignant to the
core.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>When she went home, a few minutes later, she resolved
to padlock the wicket gate&mdash;to secure it with hammer and
nails, if need be. She would not have her family subjected
to such an influence. Eileen was completely bewitched.
It was &#8220;Mrs. Ascott this&#8221; and &#8220;Lady Judith
that&#8221; from morning till night. Theo was even worse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
David was getting to look like a boy, since he had been
chatting across the wall with that designing woman.
And Larimore! He was already in her clutches. How
could a mother have been so blind? If the gate were
closed, with obvious intent, Mrs. Ascott would take the
hint, and move away.</p>

<p>Then she remembered the months that Vine Cottage
had stood idle. It was a poor time to rent a furnished
cottage, with vacation coming on, and ever so many of
the faculty houses eager to be leased for the summer
months. Besides ... Mrs. Ascott had her redeeming
points. She was never at a loss which forks to put on the
table, and how to add that chic effect to a costume. If
Eileen were to shine as Mrs. Henry Marksley, Junior,
she would need much coaching. And, after all, what had
Mrs. Ascott done? She might have gone to Italy in a
yacht. A flight in a motor car&mdash;pursuit&mdash;a broken axle&mdash;capture!
There had never been anything like that in
Lavinia Trench&#8217;s life. Then, too, her husband had deserted
her ... had run away with another woman. It
was always, in these cases, &#8220;running.&#8221; One could not
conceive of a leisurely departure from the confines of the
moral code. No doubt Mr. Ascott had abused her.
Men usually did, when they were casting amorous eyes
at some one else. That made a different case of it. Her
father had taken her back. It could not have resulted in
a public scandal. Probably the facts never leaked out.
Mrs. Ascott had certainly been received by the best society
in New York and Pelham before coming to Springdale.</p>

<p>Moreover ... this thing of nailing up gates did not
always turn out the way one expected. She had nailed
up one gate in her life that she would have given the
whole world to open. And this was such a friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
little gate. Who could tell but that some day she, Vine&mdash;the
self-sufficient&mdash;might need a friend? Mrs. Ascott
was&mdash;potent phrase&mdash;&#8220;a woman of the world.&#8221; She
made the women of Springdale look pitifully gauche.
It was not a bad idea to have such a woman as a neighbour.
Not too much intimacy. She would look to that.
She might mention.... But what was there to tell?
Mrs. Ascott had not sinned, as Adelaide Marksley had.
Herein lay the crux of the whole matter. Still ... she
was a dangerous woman. Larimore must be watched.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XV &nbsp; Masked Benefaction</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The day following her illuminating talk with her non-conformist
neighbour, Mrs. Trench remained in bed.
To some women a headache is a godsend. It obviates
the necessity for explanation. When she emerged from
the darkened room, she brought with her all the marks of
physical illness, to account for the rasped state of her
nerves; but to her son, at least, the evidence was not convincing.
He had witnessed too many narrow brushes with
Death, when Lavinia had something important to attain
or conceal. Had she waited, she might have seized on
a ready-made cause for a period of bad humour ... the
outcome of the Marksley building competition. On Saturday
afternoon the contest was settled, and Larimore
Trench was not the winner. The prize had gone to a
Chicago architect. That was not the worst of it. Mrs.
Marksley wrote Lary a letter, informing him that his
plans were too stiff and old-fashioned; but that she would
like to buy from him the design for the cow barn, which
was better in some respects than the one the up-to-date
architect had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember, Larimore, that was what I said, all
along.&#8221; Lavinia&#8217;s voice cut both ways. &#8220;And if you
had gone on, the way you did the cow barn.... I don&#8217;t
believe you have forgotten that you put the ornament on
the barn, to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t forgotten. I designed the house for
people, not for cows.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Judith heard about it, in a burst of fierce indignation,
from Theodora. It was Monday, and the atmosphere
of her home was still so forbidding that she dreaded to
enter the house, when she came from school. Mrs. Ascott
might want her to do an errand, she argued. At
least, it would do no harm to ask. But Mrs. Ascott did
not want an errand. She wanted the very information
Theo was only too eager to offer. From Eileen she had
had a shaft of unpleasant illumination: &#8220;Lary has
crawled in his hole and pulled the hole in after him.&#8221;
There was no iron in his nature, nothing with which to
fend himself against such clumsy insults. But Theodora
inadvertently revealed the deep cause of his hurt. It
was not the Marksleys, but his mother&#8217;s attitude, that
offended him.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think, Lady Judith, of those stupid Marksley
judges, turning down all Lary&#8217;s beautiful plans in favour
of&mdash;&#8221; She gasped, her cheeks burning. &#8220;I wish you
could see the front elevation of the house. It looks for
all the world like a frumpy old woman. There&#8217;s a gable
that reminds you of a poke bonnet, and under the gable
are two round windows ... like staring eyes. If I&#8217;d
gone that far, I would have had the nerve to put in a nose
and a mouth. But, no, he has a door between those windows,
opening out on a ledge. You don&#8217;t have a third
story door opening on a ledge, unless you want some one
to walk out there, in the dark, and get his neck broken.
It ought to have been a balcony. Hm-m-m, I guess he
used up all the balconies the law allows. He has them at
both sides ... like the big hips that were in style when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
mamma was a bride. And a coat of arms above the
door&mdash;the Marksleys never had a coat of arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you come to see the plans, Theo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal smuggled them over, last night, to show mamma
why Lary missed out. And she didn&#8217;t do a thing but
roast him again, this morning ... because they took the
cow barn, that he did to please her, and cut out the
classical part, that he did to please himself. That wasn&#8217;t
the only ruction we had at breakfast. But there&#8217;s no
living with my mother, these days. Papa said he
wouldn&#8217;t figure on the contract&mdash;after the way they
treated Lary. And she nearly raised the roof. I guess
my daddy&#8217;ll put in a bid, all right.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>More than once, in the weeks that followed, Judith&#8217;s
mind swung back to the words: &#8220;There&#8217;s no living with
my mother, these days.&#8221; Once she asked Dr. Schubert
about it. Might not Mrs. Trench be, in fact, a very
sick woman&mdash;keeping herself out of bed by sheer force of
her indomitable will? To which Lavinia&#8217;s physician replied,
with a none too sympathetic smile: &#8220;Yes, she is a
very sick woman ... but there is nothing in my materia
medica that will reach her case. I am looking for a return
of her old trouble&mdash;a hardening of the fluid in the
gall duct. She has passed through two sieges of jaundice.
And at another time the hardening reached the
stage of well solidified stones, that yielded to large and
persistent doses of olive oil&mdash;a remedy that Mrs. Trench
took as a peculiarly cruel and unnecessary punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to know it&#8217;s purely physical,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott
breathed. &#8220;I was afraid it was ... spleen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Schubert&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your neighbour&#8217;s liver trouble originates in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
spleen. You&#8217;ll say my anatomy is defective; but Mrs.
Trench&#8217;s body is the victim of an abnormal mind. To be
physically unfit always infuriates her. Her passionate
outbursts always react on that highly important gland,
that nature designed for the cleansing of the physical
body. Result? A clogged liver and a worse fit of
temper. Poor David! He is so fine. Life ought to
have given him velvet instead of gravel.&#8221;</p>

<p>At no time did Lavinia take to her bed for more than
a few hours, and then only when some personal triumph
was to be gained by a direct appeal to the sympathy of
her family. If she harboured a feeling of ill-will against
her neighbour, it was in effect to class her with those of
her own household. She seldom glanced into the garden
across the low stone barrier, and when she walked from
the kitchen stoop to David&#8217;s shop, at the lower end of her
own domain, she went with head inclined, as if she were
battling against a furious northern gale. Even Theodora
was beginning to practice caution, and a less amiable
maid than Drusilla would have given notice, long ago.</p>

<p>Larimore and his mother were icily polite, as was their
wont when no other form of civil intercourse was possible.
The coldness began the day after Mrs. Trench
taunted her son with his failure to win the Marksley
commission. But her smug &#8220;I told you so&#8221; had little to
do with the prolonged siege. Lary would have forgiven
her. His father had schooled him not to hold her accountable
for the bitter things she said. You could
reason with Theodora; but Lavinia....</p>

<p>No, the rancour was not on this side. His had been
the triumph. His mother had sought to deliver a blow
that must shatter his dearest idol&mdash;and the blow had
missed the mark. Dutton was wont to say that nobody
ever got ahead of Vine Trench. And in this case it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Lavinia who defeated herself. So much the worse for
Larimore, who had parried the thrust with a foreknowledge
that staggered and infuriated her.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>


<p>It was the Friday following the close of the competition,
and there were indications of a coming thaw in the
big Colonial house. The girls had betaken themselves to
Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s arbour, as soon as dinner was over. They
spent every available minute at Vine Cottage&mdash;to make
up for their mother&#8217;s open hostility. And their mother,
seeing how happy they were, had dispatched Larimore to
tell them that they were to accompany her to Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s
on some inconsequential errand. When they
had gone, Lary let himself wearily down on the bench at
Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s side. All the boyishness was gone from
his face and his eyes were deeply circled and dull. No
word passed between them. The man reflected, feeling
the warm presence so close to him, that most women
chattered, preached or philosophized without cessation,
as if the one thing demanded of femininity were an unbroken
flow of talk. Judith Ascott knew when speech
was obtrusive. She knew, too, when to break the thread
of Lary&#8217;s morbid musings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been watching that sunset? Theo called
my attention to it, before you came out. She saw, in those
clouds, the form of a woman with streaming red curls.
&#8216;The red-haired wife of the sun,&#8217; she called it. Now the
locks are straight and almost gray. I never saw such
sunsets as you have here, not even in Italy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what bewitching colour effects we had,
until I began to sit here on this bench with you. My
father has often called us to enjoy a peculiarly beautiful
sky with him. Mamma usually spoils it by reminding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
him that all the wealth of tints is produced by particles
of dirt in the atmosphere. She hates dirt, even when it
reveals itself in a form that doesn&#8217;t menace her housekeeping.
If she had gone on living in Olive Hill, I believe
she would have died of disgust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the town&mdash;the immediate environment&mdash;make
any difference, Lary? Olive Hill or Springdale, Florence
or Pelham. I have been as wretchedly unhappy and
... alone ... in a crowded Paris café as ever I was
on the deck of a steamer, in mid-ocean, when I wanted to
climb overboard and end it, in the inviting black water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You? Judith! I thought your life had been eminently
satisfactory--barring the one sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not think I have been a happy woman. I
have only been a coward&mdash;shutting the trap door on my
failures. But I don&#8217;t want to talk about myself. I have
a favour to ask. Will you&mdash;&#8221; Her voice took on the
quality of appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Judith? A favour?&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew from its envelope a letter that had come, that
afternoon, from her attorney. His partner, Mr. Sanderson,
was planning to build a home on Long Island, as
a wedding gift to his only daughter. She knew the girl&#8217;s
taste. She wanted to send the plans that Mrs. Marksley
had rejected. With such entrée as the Sandersons could
give him, Larimore Trench ought to find success in New
York. He was wasting his talents in Springdale.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good of you, my dear. But that kind of success&mdash;or
failure&mdash;doesn&#8217;t mean much to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what would satisfy you, Lary? You have so
much ability.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little of the right kind of recognition&mdash;perhaps. I
used to think I would experience the thrill at the acceptance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of a poem or essay by some discriminating editor.
The first time such an acceptance came, it left me numb
and cold with disappointment ... in myself, I mean&mdash;my
inability to rise to the occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I tell you what you want&mdash;what you demand of
life?&#8221; Some one had struck a match in her darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;wish you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing you have attained, Lary, the height you
have reached ... is under your feet. You&mdash;<i>you</i> are
superior to it. The only thing that could satisfy you
is&mdash;&#8221; she paused, a fervid instant&mdash;&#8220;the unattainable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Larimore Trench turned and looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>Dusk had settled on the garden, but Luna&#8217;s fire illuminated
her face. His body stiffened, and a dull anguish
smote him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith&mdash;God help me&mdash;the unattainable is ...
you!&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Judith Ascott had dreamed of the time when love
should come, not such love as Raoul had given her in her
romantic girlhood. Nor that other love, that had
marched with slow musical cadence into the discord of
her early maturity. It must be the masterful love, austere
and tender, a discipline and a refuge for her unruly
spirit. And now it was come ... the only love
that had ever mattered to her&mdash;the only man she had
known whose very faults and weaknesses were precious,
and she had but one impulse&mdash;to fold him in her arms and
soothe his aching spirit. Was this love? Or mayhap
the thwarted motherhood within her, that perceived in
Lary and Eileen the void left by the rebellious aversion
of the woman who was their mother in the flesh? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
long moment she scrutinized, challenged the stranger
that had arisen, unheralded and undesired, in her own
heart. Then she said, resolutely:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Lary. I am the unattainable, only so long as
I retain the wisdom to hold myself beyond your reach.
I should prove as disappointing as all the others&mdash;the
achievements that were to give you joy. The real Judith
is not the peerless being your imagination has fashioned.
Would you shrink from me in repugnance and
horror if I should tell you that my husband is not dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are another man&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was. The divorce was granted a few days before
I came to Springdale, less than three months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lary breathed a sigh so sharp that it cut him like a
knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t all. There was another man ... a
man I fancied I loved. Perhaps I pitied him. Most of
all, I pitied myself. I was more than willing to listen to
his arguments. We would go to some place where no
one knew us. We had not the courage to brush away the
falsehoods and conventions of society. I faced all the
consequences. It was no impulse of youth. I was
twenty-five, and had been married almost seven years.
We both knew what we were doing when I told him I
would go.&#8221;</p>

<p>All at once she felt the man at her side shrink&mdash;involuntarily,
she was sure. It was as if his body had repulsed
her, while his mind was striving to be just, even
magnanimous. She had thought it all out, after Theodora&#8217;s
revelation, knowing that some day Lary would
come to her with the pure white offering of his love.
And she had resolved to tell him of Herbert Faulkner&mdash;not
the fiasco, but the fact of her elopement. Perhaps
it was this submerged thought that had leaped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
surface, in her talk with Lary&#8217;s mother. With him she
would not take refuge in the timely intervention of a
broken axle and a prudent father. Her sin was as complete
as if she had carried elopement to its inevitable conclusion.
He must hear the story in all its sordid aspect.
She waited for him to speak. The clear outline of his
face cut the shadow, incisive and still as an Egyptian
profile in stone. Not a quiver of the lips betrayed his
emotion. Yet Judith Ascott knew she had dealt him the
cruelest blow of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let it interfere with our friendship, Lary?&#8221;
It was a stupid, girlish question, such as Eileen or Kitten
Henderson might have asked. She felt incredibly young
and inexperienced. When the man spoke, his voice was
hoarse with pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want friendship. I want, oh, God! the unattainable.
Judith, it is not what you have done. I am
not such a cad as to judge you. I long since freed myself
from the tyranny of an absolute thing called virtue.
That isn&#8217;t the&mdash;the obstacle. At bottom I am a selfish
brute, jealous and unreasonable. If there is another
man in the world who has meant that much to you....
Oh, not that I blame him. If I had known you when you
were another man&#8217;s wife, I wouldn&#8217;t have scrupled to
take you from him. You are my other self. I have
known it&mdash;from the moment I looked into your eyes, under
the little apricot lamp. All my life I have been
heart-hungry, wanting something I couldn&#8217;t find. Zeus
cleft us apart, in the beginning of time. And now that
you are here&mdash;&#8221; He set his teeth hard and his frame
shook.</p>

<p>A long, long time they sat silent. The night settled
about them and clouds covered the face of the moon. In
the great house next door, lights gleamed here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as the family came home and prepared for bed. Mrs.
Trench had arrived in Hal Marksley&#8217;s touring car, with
the girls. Apparently they had been for a ride. As she
went to the back door, to be sure Drusilla had put out the
milk bottles, she caught sight of the two motionless figures
in the summer house. She went to the sun room and
turned on a light that shimmered faintly through the
Venetian blinds. Judith saw, without perceiving it.
The whole irony of life lay between her and that impatient
light.</p>

<p>The tower clock chimed eleven, when, like a stage
illumination, the garden was bathed in golden glory.
With a single impulse the two on the settee turned and
looked up through the roof of the summer house, where
the vines were thin. And there, in a little clear blue lake,
piled high around the marge with mountains of sombre
clouds, the yellow moon floated, serene and detached.
Lary took the fevered hands between his cold, moist
palms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you wait for me ... wait till I can search myself?
Perhaps there is a man, hidden somewhere in the
husk of me. If I find him ... I will come and lay him
at your feet.&#8221;</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>Mrs. Trench was waiting for her son. She had dallied
too long with that warning. She was in the door of
the sun room at the first sound of his key in the lock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Larimore!&#8221; as he crossed the hall and made for the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mamma. Why aren&#8217;t you in bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something to say to you. I don&#8217;t often meddle
in your affairs; but there come times when it is a
mother&#8217;s duty to speak. I wish you would be a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
more careful in your associations with that Mrs. Ascott.
She isn&#8217;t the pure, virtuous woman we thought her. She
told me&mdash;in the most brazen way&mdash;that her husband ran
away to Africa with another woman. Though what anybody
would want to go to Africa for&mdash; But he wasn&#8217;t
entirely to blame for leaving her. She had an affair
with another man. A low scoundrel who pretended to
be her husband&#8217;s friend. She told me, without the least
bit of shame, that the only thing that saved her from
breaking her marriage vow was&mdash;her father catching up
with them, when the axle of their automobile broke&mdash;before
they reached the yacht that they were going to Italy
in ... alone ... not a touring party. Alone!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words poured forth in a disorderly phalanx.
Larimore stood patiently waiting until the need for
breath stopped her utterance. Then he said incisively:</p>

<p>&#8220;So there was a broken axle.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in a flash Lavinia knew that she had lifted a load
of doubt and misery from her son&#8217;s mind&mdash;had destroyed,
with her revelation, the barrier that stood between
him and Judith Ascott. He could hear the grinding
of her sharp teeth as he turned and ascended the
stairs.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XVI &nbsp; Coming Storm</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Mrs. Ascott and Theodora were up in the attic searching
through trunks and boxes for a fan that would harmonize
with Eileen&#8217;s graduating dress. Lavinia had
made a special trip to St. Louis in quest of accessories,
and had returned with a marvel of lacquer sticks and
landscape, befitting a mandarin&#8217;s banquet board&mdash;and
Lary had said things that threw the family into a superlative
state of stress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma and my brother don&#8217;t gee worth a cent,&#8221; the
child lamented, peering with eager eyes into the shadowy
recesses of a chest that ought to yield treasure. &#8220;For
the last month, they&#8217;re on each other&#8217;s nerves all the
time. It&#8217;s mostly Lary&#8217;s fault ... and ... I believe
he does it to save papa. My poor daddy can&#8217;t do a
blessed thing the way it ought to be. And you know,
mamma gets good and mad at only one of us at a time.
Eileen says, if she felt that way about her people, she&#8217;d
clean up the whole bunch at once, and get it out of her
&#8216;cistern.&#8217; But mamma&#8217;s just naturally economical, and
this way she can make her grouches go farther.
We thought Drusilla would quit us, last week, because
mamma laid her out so hard&mdash;when she scorched the
bottom layer of a short cake. So I guess it was a good
thing Lary said what he did about the fan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lightning rod for Drusilla,&#8221; Larimore Trench called,
from the foot of the narrow stairway. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
if I come up? I&#8217;d like to see the old attic again.&#8221; His
face was beaming and his gesture catlike as he mounted
the steep stairs. &#8220;Bob and Syd and I used to have some
wild times up here. I wonder if the ghosts of our youth
ever disturb your slumbers, sweet Lady Judith. We
were a rough trio, in our day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Sydney Schubert rough! I wonder what
you would call my two incorrigible brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they were,&#8221; Theo broke in. &#8220;Bob could
get them to do anything. We got awful quiet at our
house after he went away. Come over here, Lary,
where you can get the breeze. I&#8217;ll let you have half of
my box to sit on.&#8221; With a wisp of paper she wiped the
dust from the top of a packing case that bore in bold
black letters the legend: &#8220;Books&mdash;Keep Dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this, Lady Judith!&#8221; The small frame shook
with reminiscent mirth. &#8220;It belongs to mamma ...
twenty volumes of general information, in doses to match
the monthly payments. &#8216;Keep Dry!&#8217; You couldn&#8217;t wet
&#8217;em with a fire hose. We had to leave them here, because
Lary planned the book-cases, in the other house, so
that they wouldn&#8217;t quite go in. And mamma had one awful
set-to with Professor Ferguson when he had the nerve
to use her box of canned culture to lay out his herbarium
specimens for mounting. Sylvia said it taught mamma a
lesson. If she wanted to rent Vine Cottage, she couldn&#8217;t
go on deciding how often the silver must be polished,
and what the tenant could do with the old plunder she
left in the attic. <i>Plunder!</i> Think of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been an exemplary &#8216;landlord&#8217; since I have
been here,&#8221; Judith said, ignoring Lary and his too evident
embarrassment. &#8220;I don&#8217;t in the least mind her ordering
Dutton around. It saves my humiliating myself
in the eyes of my gardener. How was I to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that you can&#8217;t grow sweet potatoes from seed, and that
Brussels sprouts aren&#8217;t good until after frost?&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Down on the street there was a harsh grinding of
brakes and an excited cry, as Hal Marksley&#8217;s car stopped
so abruptly as to precipitate Eileen from her seat. Theodora
darted to the window, cupped her hands around
her mouth, and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on up. Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s got three fans for you
to choose from.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later, two pairs of feet were heard ascending
the stairs. A swift sense of impending disaster sent
Theo&#8217;s glance from the face of her hostess to that of her
brother. She wondered how she ought to have worded
her invitation so that Hal could not have assumed it to
include him. A young man of fine breeding would not
need to be told that she was not asking him to Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s
attic, when Mrs. Ascott had never invited him to
her reception room. He just didn&#8217;t know how to discriminate.
Lately Eileen didn&#8217;t seem to discriminate,
either. She should have told Hal not to come. He
would be terribly embarrassed, meeting Lary. But of
course neither of them knew Lary was there.</p>

<p>If young Marksley knew he was not welcome in the
sultry store room of Vine cottage, he gave no token.
Eileen&#8217;s breathless condition, when she reached the top
of the steep stair, gave him a momentary conversational
advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to my sister&#8217;s to dinner, this evening,
and the kid and I were wondering how we&#8217;d put in the
time till the rest of the folks arrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re going to <i>eat</i> again&mdash;just coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from Ina&#8217;s graduation party!&#8221; Theodora gasped.
&#8220;What did she serve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the usual sumptuous Stevens spread. What did
she have, Eileen? All I can remember is that Kitten
said she borrowed the microtome from the lab. to cut the
sandwiches. I believe there was an olive apiece, by actual
count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember, Hal? The feast began with
frappéd essence of rose fragrance, served in cocktail
glasses, with hearts of doughnuts. Then there was a
salad of last year&#8217;s ambitions and next year&#8217;s hopes.
And something to drink that had a reminiscent flavour of
coffee. But her china was lovely. She borrowed most of
it from Mrs. Marksley. That&#8217;s how Hal came to be invited
with the preps. Gee, when I ask a bunch of hungry
kids to my house, I <i>feed</i> &#8217;em. But then, I know how to
cook. And I don&#8217;t have to be so desperately dainty, for
fear of blundering in the menu.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have waited for some one else to say
that,&#8221; Larimore rebuked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! it&#8217;s a poor dog that can&#8217;t wag its own tail.
Besides, I can&#8217;t remember when you or any of my family
made me duck to keep from being pelted with praise.
That poor boy is almost starved. He pretended he
didn&#8217;t like olives, so that I could have two. And he was
about to smuggle another sandwich when Mrs. Stevens
told what they charge for a beef tongue, and how it
shrinks in cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the youth roared, &#8220;when you go to Ina&#8217;s for
a meal, your &oelig;sophagus rings a bell every time you
swallow. Her mother makes you feel as if you were
eating the grocery bill. We eat like pigs at our
house&mdash;all but sister, and she&#8217;s sure no recommendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for the æsthetic diet. She&#8217;d be a stunner, with a little
more meat on her bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eileen flushed and changed the subject. A few minutes
later, Hal lounged across the room to where Lary
and Theo sat silently side by side. He began, in a tone
that sought to be intimate:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, old man, it was a rotten shame about those
plans. I was just as sorry as could be. But my
mother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t speak of such things,&#8221; Larimore said
curtly.</p>

<p>Judith saved the situation by the timely intervention
of the fan&mdash;a woman&#8217;s device that evoked from Lary
gratitude, from Theo worship. An exclamation of delight,
a moment&#8217;s perplexed comparison, a hasty choice,
and Eileen and her uncouth cavalier were gone.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>When Theodora looked from the window, some
minutes later, the two were crossing the street in the direction
of the Nims&#8217; house. A full minute she stood, perplexed.
Then her chest heaved with futile indignation.
In that minute, the scattered troubles of the past six
weeks had danced into form, like iron filings on the glass
disc, when Sydney drew his violin bow across its vibrating
edge. She understood. Mamma had given permission
for Eileen to go with Hal to Mrs. Nims&#8217;&mdash;to dinner.
After all she had said about Mrs. Nims! A quarrel
with papa was inevitable. <i>Mamma wanted to provoke
a quarrel with papa.</i> There was no other explanation.
Things had gone from bad to worse, with only an
occasional rift in her mother&#8217;s lowering sky. Whatever
the cause of her displeasure, it had reached a climax.
Something must be done to protect papa&mdash;done quickly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Lary was not always tactful&mdash;when people acted that
way. And mamma always took it out on papa, when
Lary got the best of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Judith, couldn&#8217;t you call her to come right back
here ... eat dinner with you?&#8221; The plea tumbled
from the inchoate depth of her distress. Mrs. Ascott
and Lary interrupted a flow of intimate talk, to look at
the pale face and the preternaturally bright eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen! I think my mother has gone crazy. First
she says Mrs. Nims isn&#8217;t fit for a decent woman to speak
to&mdash;when papa talked about Christian charity&mdash;and now
she lets Eileen go over there to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that, baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Lary Trench, look for yourself. I guess I
can put two and two together. If I didn&#8217;t want papa
to think Mrs. Nims was a dangerous woman&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t
tell him that Christ himself couldn&#8217;t save her. Either
my mother hasn&#8217;t got any system at all ... or ...
she wants to have one awful row with my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might as well face a sickeningly unpleasant situation,&#8221;
Larimore said to Judith. &#8220;You are seeing my
mother at her absolute worst. Something has occurred
to annoy her, desperately. And we can&#8217;t even surmise
what it is. The baby and I have laid plots to trap her
into betraying the cause of her hurt. But only last night
we acknowledged ourselves beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I confess that I have been trying, too, at Dr.
Schubert&#8217;s suggestion? He tells me that this state of her
mind may lead to serious consequences. Some obscure
liver trouble, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not obscure,&#8221; Lary amended. &#8220;Dr. Schubert understands
its pathological aspect. It is the mental
cause that baffles all of us. Gall stones are not uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in women of my mother&#8217;s temperament. She has
too much energy for the small engine she has to operate.
Her physician has tried to impress on her the need for
keeping herself tranquil. He might as well advise a
tornado to be calm and rational.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet she does take advice from him&mdash;if he makes it
specific and definite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the index to my mother&#8217;s mind&mdash;that cost
me years of search. She learns one thing at a time.
She has no faculty for making logical deductions. When
she tries to apply a known principle to a new set of conditions
the chances are nine to one that she will go
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the woman&#8217;s eyes turned to Theodora
... impelled by some unrecognized attraction. The
little head was nodding in sage approval. She was only
half conscious of what those two were saying. The fact
that it was intimate&mdash;confidential&mdash;sufficed. Things
were coming on, entirely to her liking. It was almost the
end of June, and she wanted to be sure there would be no
backslidings, while she and her mother were in Minneapolis,
the following month. She had never been anywhere&mdash;excepting
the week in St. Louis for the Exposition,
when she was seven&mdash;and a trip up the river on a
steamer had been particularly alluring. Now she would
almost rather not go. She might be needed. Oh, not
to patch up a quarrel! Lary and Lady Judith were too
wellbred for that. But Lary did need to have his courage
bucked up, now and then.</p>

<p>She was only a child, she reflected, but she knew that
when people were in love, they had no business mooning
around in the dark&mdash;<i>in separate yards</i>. She could go
over the wall without touching anything but her hands.
And Lary was much more athletic than she. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the gate was there&mdash;even if mamma did padlock it, one
morning. What if Lady Judith should try to go through
that gate&mdash;and have her feelings hurt!</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Theodora glanced up from her troubled musings to
perceive that she was quite alone in the attic. They had
gone and left her. They had forgotten all about her.
She sprang from the packing case and danced for joy.
It was the first time in all her life that Lary had forgotten
her. It was the best omen of all. They were
standing at the foot of the stairs&mdash;and they weren&#8217;t saying
a word. She paused, on tiptoe, afraid to breathe
lest she break the witching spell. What did people think
about, when they were all alone in that kind of heaven?
Now she heard their feet on the lower stairs. She hurried
to the window to see them go down to the grassy plot
before the house, where her father joined them.</p>

<p>The rosy picture was obscured, in an instant, as if she
had spilled the ink bottle over it, and daddy&#8217;s danger
loomed before her. She trudged wearily down to join
them on the grass. Things never were what you thought
they were going to be. When she reached the edge of
the veranda, a pair of strong arms caught her in a yearning
embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to congratulate your papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any reason. Did you get the Marksley
contract?&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s transparent face darkened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... but that&#8217;s not a matter for congratulation.
I figured so high that I counted on escaping. I didn&#8217;t
want it at any price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, this was the annual meeting of the college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Board&mdash;and they elected your papa treasurer. When
Dr. Clarkson made his nominating speech, I didn&#8217;t dream
he was talking about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma said this morning that they&#8217;d shove it off on
you&mdash;after the way the last two treasurers handled the
funds. She couldn&#8217;t see why you would want to do all
that work, just to be called the most honest man on the
Board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma and I don&#8217;t always look at things alike.
Come, my dears, she is at the door, and dinner may be
waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen went to a party, over at Ina&#8217;s,&#8221; Theo cried,
mindful of danger. To herself she added: &#8220;Well, she
did. I didn&#8217;t tell him she wasn&#8217;t there still.&#8221; Daddy
must not find out that she was right across the street.
There had been too many disagreements, and it never
did daddy any good to fight back. He always got the
worst of it, and it made him sick. She wanted to ask
Mrs. Ascott to come with them, and eat dinner in Eileen&#8217;s
place. Mamma would hardly raise a scene before company.
As the invitation took shape on her lips, it was
halted by her mother&#8217;s curt voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you like your victuals cold, the way you
stand there and gossip.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three Trenches stepped over the wall, which at
the front was little more than an ornamental coping,
and Judith went in to her lonely meal.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Dinner was scarcely over when the room was plunged
in a glare of fire, the startling illumination followed almost
instantly by thunder that crackled and smote.
Then the storm, that had hovered all afternoon in the
sultry air, broke with the fury of explosively released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
wind and rain. Nanny called for help, as the deluge
poured through the screens at three sides of the cottage in
quick succession. Before the east windows had been
closed, the rain was driving straight from the south&mdash;and
the attic window wide open. Nanny&#8217;s bulk halted
at the foot of the breath-exhausting stairs, and her mistress
ran past her, to make good the publisher&#8217;s injunction,
&#8220;Keep Dry.&#8221; When the sash had been lowered,
Judith went to the rear of the attic and looked down into
the garden, tossing in the summer storm.</p>

<p>Sharp, hissing flames heralded the detonation of thunder
such as she had heard nowhere save in the Alps or
the tropics. The earth, a moment ago black with the
pall of midnight, leaped into the semblance of a stage
set with dancing marionets, that vanished in the ensuing
darkness to rise again with the next purple flash. Now
the wind swooned, lay panting and breathless against the
palpitating bosom of the earth. And now it leaped with
renewed ardour, gripped the pear tree and shook it as an
ill-controlled mother shakes an unruly child. One of the
trellises at the east side of the lawn went over with a
crash, carrying in its wake a shower of Prairie Queen
roses. The Dorothy Perkins looked on with serene security
from the shoulder of the garage, her petals draggled,
but exultant in the garish light.</p>

<p>The air was clearing now. Gradually the tender
green corn slumped down in the softened loam and a disconsolate
toad hopped mournfully across the white gravel
walk. This was too much even for a toad. With
a long, soul-sickening lunge he disappeared in the shrubbery,
as the thunder rumbled its retreat behind the western
horizon. Out of its dying reverberation, music came floating
up through the moist air ... marvellous strains.
Judith crossed the attic and threw open the window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Yes, her surmise was right. Eileen and Mrs. Nims
were playing Debussy&#8217;s matchless tone picture, &#8220;Garden
in the Rain,&#8221; the &#8217;cello blending exquisitely with the
piano. Would David hear? Would he recognize his
daughter&#8217;s touch? But Eileen had never played like
this. The tones came, moist and meaningful, lulling the
conscious mind to dreams, steeping the senses in the
drowsy calm that follows the delirium of summer heat.</p>

<p>Judith Ascott felt her soul at one with the garden ...
arid clay, whose thirst had been quenched. She had
played Debussy&#8217;s imagist arrangement, and had rejected
it because it failed to symbolize a prosaic natural phenomenon.
Now she knew that it was not the rain, but
the garden, which the composer had in mind. She had
approached the theme from overhead, just as a moment
ago she had looked down on her own garden. With a
thrill she perceived Debussy&#8217;s thought in all its naked,
elemental beauty&mdash;the primitive consciousness of maternal
Earth, glad and grateful for the benison of summer
rain.</p>

<p>Had something new come into Eileen&#8217;s playing? Was
it Adelaide Marksley&#8217;s &#8217;cello that made the elusive
thought tangible? Was it, rather, something that had
come into her own soul? She had been so long athirst.
Must one faint beneath the heat, brave the wind and the
lightning&#8217;s terror, in order to drink in at last the bountiful
rain? Was there any price one would not pay for
such peace as had found habitation within her soul?</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>In the morning the mistress of Vine Cottage went out
to inspect the havoc the storm had wrought. Dutton
was down on his knees, righting the vivid green corn
stalks and banking them in with the soft soil. Theodora
stood on the gravel walk, watching him with elfin
curiosity&mdash;his shins protected by huge pads of faded
brussels carpet, his fingers so packed with mud that they
resembled a sculptor&#8217;s model in the rough. When she
caught sight of Mrs. Ascott she crossed the intervening
lawn on dainty toes, like a kitten afraid of the wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any trouble about Eileen,&#8221; she began
in a whisper pregnant with meaning. &#8220;I fixed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were a good little angel. Have you a kiss for
me this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A million of them ... but only one, now.&#8221; She
pursed her lips with strigine solemnity. The kiss was
a rite&mdash;not to be taken frivolously. &#8220;I have to tell you
about it. I don&#8217;t think it was half bad&mdash;for a kid like
me. It didn&#8217;t look as if it would work, when I started
in. But if you are in as tight a pinch as that, you have
to jump where there looks like an opening. Then I had
to see it through. There wasn&#8217;t any chance to back out.&#8221;
The sentence was somewhat chaotic, but the meaning was
plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we started in the house, I let mamma and Lary
get clear inside the hall. Then I pulled papa back and
whispered in his ear&mdash;that Eileen was over at Mrs. Nims&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and for him not to let on that he missed her. He asked
me why, and I told him that if he was any sport at all,
he&#8217;d do as I said, <i>and not ask any questions</i>. And what
do you think, Lady Judith ... he was game! Mamma
threw out one hook after another, to make him ask
where Eileen was. And every time he turned and looked
at me&mdash;and I gave him the most awful glances, behind
my napkin. The only thing he could think of, right
quick, was getting made treasurer of the college trustees.
And I don&#8217;t know why mamma didn&#8217;t smell something,
because it isn&#8217;t the least bit like my daddy to boast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then the storm may have helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa said that was sent by Divine Providence.
It gave me a chance to explain to him&mdash;while mamma was
chasing all over the house, putting down windows, and
screaming at Drusilla as if the house was on fire. I told
him that mamma was mad as a wet hen&mdash;and just bound
and determined to start something, with him ... and
he <i>mustn&#8217;t</i> fall for it. Lady Judith, I wish my daddy
had more sand. He choked up&mdash;like he was about to
cry&mdash;and said he didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with
mamma. He tried every way to please her and make
her happy. He asked me if I knew why she was so cross
all the time ... and I fibbed an awful fib. I told him
Dr. Schubert said she had rocks in her liver and that
would make a saint cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes danced with roguish mirth, then fell. When
she raised them again to the woman&#8217;s face, they were full
of obstinate purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it was a sin and God will punish me. Well,
let Him ... if He feels that way about it. I&#8217;d take a
whipping any day, to keep my daddy from getting one.
If your soul is so nice that you can&#8217;t fib once in a while,
to help a fellow out of trouble&mdash;&#8221; She battled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
futility of language to convey the situation as she perceived
it. &#8220;Still, I wouldn&#8217;t want you to think it was
wrong ... telling a story, to keep some one out of a
scolding&mdash;some one that never did a mean thing in his
whole life. Do you&mdash;do you think it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You darling!&#8221; Aching arms encircled her. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how to answer you. We both know that it is
wrong, in the abstract, to tell lies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I never tell them in the abstract. It&#8217;s only
when there isn&#8217;t any other way.&#8221; The explanation
threatened to assume the solemnity of a lecture on pragmatism.
&#8220;I have wanted to tell you&mdash;ever since Lary
said I was a conscienceless fibber. It&#8217;s one thing I can&#8217;t
make him understand, and he knows everything else without
being told. When you want a thing to be a certain
way, and it isn&#8217;t that way at all, you can&#8217;t use the facts.
<i>They don&#8217;t fit.</i> And what good does it do&mdash;to keep saying
a thing over, the way you don&#8217;t want it to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A popular religion was founded on that premise,
dearie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m talking about hasn&#8217;t got anything to do
with religion. Bob used to say, &#8216;A lie is an abomination
in the sight of the Lord, and a very present help in time
of trouble.&#8217; But I would never fib to keep myself out
of trouble. You have to save them ... till there&#8217;s
something important. If I hadn&#8217;t told Lary you didn&#8217;t
like the apricot lamp shade, he wouldn&#8217;t have thought of
going over to call on you&mdash;till Syd Schubert or some
other man fell in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia Trench&#8217;s strident voice rasped the sweet morning
air. Theo was having altogether too pleasant a
time, over there in Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s garden. That which
she had related would have stung her mother to madness.
But Theo&#8217;s afterthought was a little outcropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of Lavinia herself. In Dutton&#8217;s phrase: &#8220;That woman&#8217;ll
have something stickin&#8217; in her craw for years&mdash;and she&#8217;ll
have to fetch it out, in spite of the devil. If you ever
make her sore, or do her a bad turn&mdash;you might think
she forgot it&mdash;but the time&#8217;ll come when she lets you hear
about it.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>When the child had gone, Dutton untied the pads from
his knees and approached his mistress. The wind had
wrecked the frail framework which he had constructed
of lath and the refuse from David Trench&#8217;s shop, to support
the rank growth of tomato vines, over there by the
wall. He admitted, shamefacedly, that he &#8220;knowed
them end supports was too weak,&#8221; when he put them in.
He wondered if Mrs. Ascott would mind helping him.
Mrs. Dutton was in a bad humour, on account of some
words she had had with Mrs. Trench. And Nanny was
no good for carpenter work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not much of a carpenter&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s just that Nanny&#8217;s feet&#8217;s too
big. She gets in the way. I thought I might call Dave
over to he&#8217;p me; but he&#8217;s been out in the shop runnin&#8217;
the scroll saw for dear life, since right after breakfast.
The old boy&#8217;s goin&#8217; through his hells again. I tell you,
ma&#8217;am, it&#8217;s an awful mistake to call a girl &#8216;Vine&#8217; and then
give her no mind to cling. When she&#8217;s in one o&#8217; her tantrums,
she wouldn&#8217;t see the Lord Jesus Christ if she
met Him in the middle of the road&mdash;and she sets a heap
o&#8217; store by the Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was only one way to handle Jeff Dutton. An
open rebuke was invariably followed by a day of insolent
idleness. Mrs. Ascott had heard him quarrel with Lavinia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Trench in a manner to indicate that one of them, at
least, had not forgotten their former state of social
equality. The pointed ignoring of his familiar gossip
usually proved efficacious. He followed his mistress to
the loamy bed in the sheltered angle between the garage
and the wall, where downy leaved vines and splintered
lath lay in a hopeless tangle on the ground. A while
they worked, side by side, the sullen silence broken only
by the whirring of David&#8217;s saw. Judith&#8217;s fingers were
verde and odorous, and the hem of her skirt was adorned
with a batik pattern of grotesque figures in the harmonious
hues of earth and vine. Nanny would scold.
But what was the good of a garden, if one must only be
a disinterested onlooker? Suddenly Dutton yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;There! Grab &#8217;er quick! This end&mdash;can&#8217;t you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment he offered profuse apology. But
his mistress was ready for the emergency. It was necessary
for him to go into the garage and cut another support
to take the place of the one that had snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better put this &#8217;ere pad on the ground, under your
right foot, while you hold &#8217;er up. Them slippers is
mighty thin. I won&#8217;t be gone a minute.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Dutton&#8217;s minute was always a variable quantity, and
this time it lengthened itself until the woman&#8217;s arms and
shoulders ached, from the unwonted strain. But she
was glad of the interval&mdash;glad that only she was forced
to hear snatches of the conversation that took place in
the shop at the other side of the wall. One of the voices
was low and appealing, the other raucous with purposeful
anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see, my dear, why you want to go to Bromfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
this summer, when you have all your plans made to
take the trip to St. Paul on the boat. You have always
refused to visit Bromfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. You never want me to go anywhere&mdash;have
any pleasure&mdash;or even a vacation when you see
that the work is killing me. You gad around as much as
you like. You&#8217;ve been away five times this spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly don&#8217;t go for pleasure, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t &#8216;my dear&#8217; me! I&#8217;m sick and tired of it.
That&#8217;s all I ever get. You expect me to slave and stint
myself and stay at home, so that you and the children
can make a big showing. And I&#8217;m supposed to be happy
and contented on your everlasting &#8216;my dears.&#8217; I tell you,
there&#8217;s got to be a change in this family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there in Bromfield that you want to see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think I might want to see my brother. And
a daughter might want to put flowers on her parents&#8217;
graves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t it, Vine. Why don&#8217;t you tell me the truth?
I would give you anything in my power, that would make
you happy. It&#8217;s this underhanded way you have, that
hurts me. I don&#8217;t care where you go or what you do,
if you&#8217;ll only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Dutton came from the garage, to be
greeted by a volley of questions and suggestions. Fortunately,
as he worked, his deaf ear was turned towards
David Trench&#8217;s shop. Scarcely had the last nail been
driven when Mrs. Trench emerged from the building
and strode triumphantly towards the back stoop. For
her the universe was a straight line. Everything above,
beneath and beside it had melted into oblivion. The
line ended in a point on the map of New York, known to
the initiate as Bromfield.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XVIII &nbsp; Sylvia</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Throughout the months of May and June the battle
had raged&mdash;Lavinia Trench&#8217;s battle, not with her family
but with herself. She knew, as all those in her little
world knew, that a visit to Bromfield was not the difficult
thing she had made it. Times without number David
had implored her to go with him especially when there
was serious illness or death in one or the other of their
families. And now that she had achieved her purpose,
knowing all the while, somewhere in the depths of her,
hope of conquest on a certain perfectly definite object,
and had bent her tremendous energy in that direction&mdash;knowing
all the while, somewhere in the depths of her,
that the enemy lay entrenched in quite another quarter.</p>

<p>In those former struggles, in which she had invariably
bent David to her will, she had rewarded him with a period
of forced sweetness which he was glad to take in lieu
of the comradeship he had long since ceased to hope for.
It had been this way when they made the perilous move
from Olive Hill, where he was doing remarkably well,
working at a daily wage, to Springdale, where he must
hazard all he had saved ... to give his wife the social
advantage she could not find in a dirty mining town.
But Lavinia had no instinct for society, derived no immediate
satisfaction from such triumphs as had come to
her. It appeared to David&#8217;s simple and always lucid
mind that she created situations for the sheer purpose of
annihilating them. In every crisis in their lives, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
owned in retrospect that Lavinia was right. Had he
understood the situation, a frank discussion would have
won him. It was her method of approach that seemed
to him unnecessarily cruel.</p>

<p>She had, from childhood, viewed David Trench as an
amiable yokel, to be blindfolded and led about by the
hand. And now one sentence in his talk, that morning
in the shop, rankled: &#8220;Who is it that you want to see in
Bromfield?&#8221; She had been telling herself over and over
again that there was no one in particular she wanted to
see. Her essentially prudish mind shrank from the
naked truth that stalked before her, in the dark hours of
the night, with David peacefully sleeping at her side.
But negation was not conquest. In vain she declared to
her own soul that Calvin Stone was nothing to her. She
could meet him without a tremor. She tried to picture
him, old and scarred by life&mdash;shrinking from her gaze,
because of the stain on his fair name. She saw him, instead,
a debonair youth of three-and-twenty, the sort of
fellow who would kiss a girl ... and argue about it
afterward.</p>

<p>There had been periods, weeks and even months, when
the foothills of her immediate environment had obscured
that treeless mountain peak in her life&mdash;the irreparable
injury she had suffered. But something always happened
to bring her perfidious lover once more within her ken.
Never so poignantly as when Mrs. Ascott unwittingly
revealed the reason for Calvin&#8217;s hasty marriage. She
had fancied such an explanation ... had been sure that
the certainty of it would be anodyne for her deep hurt.
Instead it had served only to tear open the old wound,
to set it festering with the toxin of that other unstudied
remark: &#8220;He afterward tried to get out of it.&#8221; Had not
Calvin&#8217;s father foreshadowed this very contingency?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Lettie&#8217;s husband might sicken of his bargain&mdash;might come
back to his first love, to plead for her forgiveness and
the boon of her restored favour.</p>

<p>She would keep this idea uppermost in her mind, when
she went to Bromfield. It not only served to soothe her
vanity, but it would be a whip with which to lash the man
who had wronged her. No, she would not give him the
satisfaction of thinking she regretted her own hasty marriage.
She would make him believe she had been infinitely
the gainer when she married David Trench. The
idea was so preposterous that, given a less subjective
sense of humour, she might have laughed at it. But David
had been that kind of stalking horse before.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>David leaned against the wall, his tired eyes resting
fondly on the garden where his children had romped.
He was telling Mrs. Ascott the origin of the summer
house&mdash;that he had built as a surprise for his wife, the
spring she went to visit Lary in Ithaca, his first year in
college. In those days Sylvia was the honey-pot for a
swarm of students, and an occasional mature man, and a
folding tea table in an outdoor living-room covered with
kudzu and crimson rambler was an added attraction.
Lavinia joined them, her cheeks flushed, her dark eyes
ablaze with animation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to be compelled to get along without
me for a few weeks, Mrs. Ascott. My husband is sick
and tired of seeing me around, and he&#8217;s going to bundle
me up and send me home to my own people. It&#8217;s the
first trip I&#8217;ve had in years ... always tied down to
home and my children. Is there anyone in Rochester
you&#8217;d like to send a message to? I haven&#8217;t seen dear old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
New York state since I left there, twenty-eight years ago
next November.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Vine, I was just telling Mrs. Ascott about
building the little summer house for you, when you
went to see Lary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia Trench flushed, not the slow red that betokened
deep wrath, but a light wave of crimson that
swallowed up the hectic spots in her cheeks, that tinged
the hollow of her temples and the taut skin of her high
and slightly receding forehead. It was gone in an instant,
leaving in its wash a strained look of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never think of that as a visit. I went in such a
hurry&mdash;and then I didn&#8217;t have time to go over to Bromfield,
because ... you wrote me that Sylvia had a cold
and Robert had sprained his wrist. I never go away
from home without something dreadful happening. I
wonder what Sylvia will say when she gets my telegram
to-night. I hope she won&#8217;t be frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to telegraph Sylvia? What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want her to look after the children while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t taking them with you&mdash;after promising
Eileen that she might spend the summer with her cousin,
Alice Larimore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice rest I would have&mdash;dragging two children
around with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t need to have their bottles fixed.&#8221; David
smiled in spite of his perplexity. &#8220;I had counted on this
summer&mdash;to break up the infatuation for young Marksley.
I thought you agreed with me. It was your solution.
You told me not to say anything about it until vacation,
and that you would send Eileen away.&#8221;</p>

<p>David might have spared his breath. The telegram
was already on the wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Sylvia Penrose came home in time for commencement.
It was her first visit since the gold-lined catastrophe
whereby she was shorn of the coveted &#8220;Mrs. Professor,&#8221;
and she brought with her more pretty clothes than anyone
in Springdale had dreamed of&mdash;outside a department
store. Her father watched her uneasily, the first evening.
He saw a marked change in her, and the quality of
it disturbed him. Could a child of his acquire such a degree
of cynical world-wisdom in a brief ten months?
Had Sylvia changed, or was he seeing her for the first
time, as she was?</p>

<p>David was not given to introspection. The chambers
of his heart were filled with the ghosts of dreams and
longings that had perished ... yet would not lie quiet
in the graves to which his acquiescent mind had consigned
them. One could always take refuge from the hurt of
life in the tangible things that life had imposed. He
took refuge, now, in his wife&#8217;s vivid charm, her spontaneous
return to health and buoyancy. Barring a certain
smugness, that had come to be an essential fibre of her
mental woof, she was amazingly attractive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might easily pass for Mrs. Penrose&#8217;s sister,&#8221;
Judith exclaimed, astonished at the apparition of
Lavinia in a cameo pink negligée with wide frills of cream
lace. And, Lavinia, smarting under the lash of her
daughter&#8217;s comments regarding the morning jacket&mdash;and
the foolish old women who tried to prolong youth by
such ill-considered devices&mdash;turned to preen herself before
the mirror.</p>

<p>She had fully intended to prime Sylvia, with regard to
Larimore and the dangerous widow; but that burst of
spontaneous praise disarmed her. She did not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
neglect to make plain her intentions in another quarter.
Hal Marksley was to be treated with proper respect. It
would not be a bad idea to have the engagement&mdash;the
wedding, even&mdash;consummated before her return from
Bromfield. Any one with a grain of sense must know
that a fellow as popular and rich as Hal&mdash;with half the
girls in town after him&mdash;would not stand such snubbing
as he had received from the men of the household. He
was of age ... and Eileen could easily pass herself off
for eighteen or twenty if she did up her hair and went
to Greenville where she was not known. Papa and Larimore
were absolutely insane not to see that a girl with
Eileen&#8217;s impetuous nature.... Mrs. Trench did not
finish the sentence. She and Sylvia understood each
other.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>After the train had gone the big house was unbearably
lonely, reft of the all pervasive personality that dominated
its moods of sunshine and gloom. Early Sunday
afternoon David passed through the wicket gate and
sought his neighbour in the summer house. One by one
the other Trenches joined them. For a time Sylvia went
about with her brother, examining old familiar objects,
assuming charming attitudes, giving vent to laughter that
rippled in measured cadence. Theodora watched her,
wondering what kind of impression she was making.
Sylvia was like mamma&mdash;always sure of herself. Lary
and Eileen were like papa. And she&mdash;she wasn&#8217;t like
anybody. Just a little remnant that had been patched
together, out of the left-overs of the other children.</p>

<p>She came out of her musings to hear her father say:
&#8220;Mrs. Ascott, you don&#8217;t know what it means to live with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one person until that person becomes part of your very
body. When Vine is away.... I do everything left-handed.
It&#8217;s as if a piece of me was gone, here.&#8221; He
slipped a hand under his left arm, and his eyes smiled
mournfully. &#8220;I am always turning to look for her, and
the vacancy makes me dizzy.&#8221;</p>

<p>How stupid to miss the first part of such a conversation!
And now Lady Judith wouldn&#8217;t say anything in reply&mdash;because
the others were coming for afternoon tea,
with Nanny, an exaggerated cocoa girl in white cap and
apron, bearing a steaming samovar and a wide range of
accessories to suit the prejudice of those who preferred
their Sunday afternoon tipple hot or cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so foolish for the Fourth to come on Sunday&mdash;and
have to save up all your fire-crackers till to-morrow,&#8221;
the child began disconsolately, choosing a macaroon from
the embarrassing variety of small cakes in the silver
basket. &#8220;Hal says the Governor can&#8217;t come; but there
will be a better orator to spread the eagle in the stadium.
He didn&#8217;t ask me to go with him and Eileen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought all three of my daughters were going with
me,&#8221; David pleaded, his eyes seeking Eileen&#8217;s. But Sylvia
dispensed with argument:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, mamma said I was to take Theo to the stadium
with us. There isn&#8217;t room for her in Hal&#8217;s little car.
And besides, I know how I used to hate to have the
younger children tagging after me, when I was having
company. I&#8217;ve asked Dr. Schubert and Syd to join us,
and they&#8217;ll come home for a spread, after the celebration.
Mrs. Ascott, I hope you&#8217;ll come, too. I have already
asked Hal. Syd has promised to help me with the serving.
He ought to make some woman a good husband&mdash;the
training I gave him when we were growing up.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIX &nbsp; A Web in the Moonlight</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Judith was glad, afterward, that the responsibility for
Eileen had been lifted from David Trench&#8217;s shoulders,
howsoever humiliating the conditions might be. All that
would have made for guidance had long since been
wrested from his hands, and the inevitable pain would be
robbed of the corrosive quality of self-reproach. She
wondered what he was thinking, that portentous Monday
evening, as he gazed past her and Theodora to the
row of seats across the aisle where Hal and Eileen sat,
munching popcorn and making audible comments on the
speeches, comments that bubbled with cleverness not always
refined in its quality.</p>

<p>Just as the perspiring statesman appeared on the flag-draped
platform, bearing a message from the Governor
of the state, Dr. Schubert and his son came down the aisle,
looking to right and left with searching eyes. Theodora
stood on tiptoe to signal them. There was a shifting of
the original seating arrangement, so that Sydney and Sylvia
might be together. The first few sentences of the
florid oration were lost in the general confusion, and
when Judith looked again into the row of seats across the
aisle, two places were vacant. Hal and Eileen had gone.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>After the fireworks the town went home. Sydney
Schubert walked with Sylvia, talking of other Fourth of
July experiences in a tone from which the restraint of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
disappointed lover was wholly wanting. David played
sweetheart to Theodora, a rôle that had been developed
by long practice. It came to Judith, walking behind
them with Lary and Dr. Schubert, that David Trench
was essentially a lover&mdash;and love must have something to
feed upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will we wait for Eileen?&#8221; he asked, when the feast
had been prepared.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be here any minute,&#8221; Sylvia cried flippantly.
Then, in a voice that echoed her mother&#8217;s objurgatory
habit of speech: &#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, papa, stop worrying
about that girl. She&#8217;s old enough to take care of
herself. Syd and I were traipsing all over the country
when I was her age, and I can&#8217;t remember that you sat up
nights worrying about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Marksley isn&#8217;t Sydney Schubert,&#8221; her father
reminded her.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>It was one o&#8217;clock when the merry party separated, and
still no Eileen. A light rain was falling, and the coat
closet must be searched for umbrellas. Lary lingered at
Judith Ascott&#8217;s door, unwilling to say good night. Some
misshapen apprehension that had tormented him all evening
struggled for expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe, Judith, that whatever is, is right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can recall the time, less than six months ago, when I
was convinced that whatever is&mdash;is wrong,&#8221; she answered,
mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; He searched her face, there in the moist
dusk of the veranda. When he spoke again, it was with
something of Theo&#8217;s kindling animation: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what you have done to me. A moment ago I was facing
a great onrushing wall of black water. And all at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it has broken into ripples of silver joy. Last night I
watched a great black and yellow spider, playing with his
web in the moonlight. He was such a handsome, capable
fellow&mdash;and the moth was so blunderingly stupid.
I wondered if there were not something to be said in
favour of the spider. But&mdash;you will think me a fatalist,
if I finish the thought I had in mind. You will believe
me when I tell you that I am not, in the least?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Lary, I will not believe you&mdash;one whit more than
I can believe that it was an empty accident that brought
me to Springdale&mdash;to Vine Cottage&mdash;four months ago.
You and Eileen and I are caught in the web. The spider
is Fate. I begged the gods to burn my fingers with the
fire of life ... and they heard my prayer....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You delicious pagan! I might fancy gentle Clotho
spinning a silken strand for you. But to sear your fingers&mdash;&#8221;
He caught them and pressed them to his lips.
Then he hurried across the lawn in a panic, his bare head
wet with the summer rain. Judith looked after him,
Sylvia&#8217;s best umbrella in her hand. She wanted to call
him back, but it would only mean a double wetting. And
Sylvia need not know.</p>

<p>She went up to her room but not to sleep. Taking
down the thick coils of her pale chestnut hair, she braided
it deliberately. A strand, blown across her face by the
breeze from the west window, reminded her, all at once,
of the web. She relaxed weakly on a hassock, watching
the glittering drops on the edge of the awning that
shaded her window from the afternoon sun. Was the
web inevitable ... Fate? As yet she was free. Could
she view with equanimity a future that involved, not
Lary and his two young sisters, but those others who
were of his flesh? Could she bear the heartache that was
David Trench? Could she.... Her head drooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
low on the window sill and her mind drifted rudderless on
a sea of dreams.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>When Hal and Eileen left the stadium it was in accordance
with a prearranged plan to meet Ina and Kitten
and two of the boys who had contrived the loan of a
touring car for the evening. They would drive to Olive
Hill for the celebration&mdash;the exciting part of it. Competitive
drilling, not in gaudy uniforms, but that more
useful drilling that had to do with ledges of shale and
limestone. It was at best but a poor imitation of the
annual drill contest in the gold mining country, where
powerful muscles contended with steel bitted drills
against the tough impediment of granite. Here the
very ledge had to be faked&mdash;removed from the nearby
hillside with infinite care, and mounted against an improvised
wall of mine refuse. It was the best the coal mines
of Illinois could afford, but it served its purpose. There
were money prizes and lesser trophies&mdash;geese, chickens
and baskets of provisions.</p>

<p>The contest finished, there was a dance in the pavilion.
Hal had parked his roadster where he and Eileen could
watch the antics of the dancers. He was not sorry when
he learned that the borrowed car must be returned by
midnight, and the others must be on their way towards
Springdale. He and Eileen would be following in a little
while, he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying all evening to dodge them,&#8221; he
added, as he waved farewell to the departing car.
&#8220;Some people simply can&#8217;t take a hint.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nestled close. &#8220;Just you and me ... all
alone in the universe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetheart,&#8221; Hal slipped his arm around her waist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and laid his cheek against hers, &#8220;it&#8217;s all fixed with my
father. He&#8217;s set on having me go to Pratt; but he&#8217;s
agreed on an allowance that ought to take care of two.
We&#8217;re in luck that you can cook. And you won&#8217;t mind
a little flat? I can count on Adelaide to help us out if we
get in a pinch. Of course my mother&#8217;ll raise Cain&mdash;and
I&#8217;ll be on the lookout for a job, from the start. If they
think I&#8217;m going to wait all that time for you&mdash;why, I
can&#8217;t, Eileen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s breath came so thick, it choked her. The
dancers swam dizzily before her eyes. The saplings in
the little grove took up the dance, swaying with uncertain
rhythm, their lithe trunks bending to the tumult in her
brain. &#8220;Do you love me well enough to get along that
way for a year or two? Will you come to me, sweetheart,
when I send for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the rain. Men and women went scurrying
to places of shelter. The thin grove, the pavilion with
its dilapidated roof, the mine house&mdash;whose inner spaces
were always barred to the public as soon as the last workman
had gone&mdash;these offered meagre protection. Over
there behind the mine dump was a corn crib and feed
room where provender for the now obsolete pit mules
had formerly been kept. No one else had thought of
this refuge. Hal and Eileen were alone, the rain
pounding on the rusty tin roof to the tune of their madly
beating hearts.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>How long Judith lay asleep she did not know. She
was aroused at length by voices, so close that they seemed
to emanate from the lawn beneath her window. She
tried to move. Her arm, her neck, her shoulder creaked
with pain. She must have been there in that cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
position a long time. Her hair and her thin negligée
were quite damp. As her scattered senses collected
themselves she realized that the sound came from beyond
the wall. A voice, hoarse with rapture, Eileen&#8217;s voice,
murmured over and over:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, darling, I never knew I loved you until now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some high platitude touching manly fidelity punctuated
the girl&#8217;s impassioned utterance. The façade of the
house lay in ghostly shadows that enveloped the figures
completely. But out there across the lawn lay the white
moonlight, frosting the wet grass with a shimmering incrustation
of unearthly jewels. Hal Marksley&#8217;s substantial
form came like a skulking wraith from the
gloom, gliding along the thin edge of the shadow until he
reached a convenient screen of shrubs, vaulted over the
wall and crossed close beneath Judith&#8217;s casement. He
was cranking the reluctant engine of his motor car, out
there in the side street, as the clock in the chapel tower
struck three.</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>It was ten o&#8217;clock when Eileen came down stairs, refused
breakfast and wandered listlessly out into the hot
July air. She was pale and her full lips were swollen.
Her eyes were set in murky pools of shadow, as yellow
as ochre, beneath their screen of long lashes, and her
blond braids hung stiff and obdurate. As she entered
the summer house, Theodora greeted her with a derisive
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Judith, tell her what she missed. I never saw
the automobile yet that could take me away from such a
lobster salad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she didn&#8217;t know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed she did. She made the mayonnaise herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Sylvia can&#8217;t hit it one time in three. And mamma and
Drusilla ... the oil always separates, on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Separates on them!&#8221; Eileen sniffed. &#8220;Where do you
get that line of talk?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had relaxed on the oaken bench and sat kicking the
gravel with the toe of her loose slipper. After a time
she broke the sullen silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be discourteous to you, Lady Judith.
That&#8217;s what Sylvia scolded me about; but that wasn&#8217;t
what she had in mind. She&#8217;s sore because I didn&#8217;t bring
Hal to her party. I knew what kind of a frosty
shoulder he&#8217;d get from Lary and papa. And the way
she fawns over him! It makes me sick. He hates to be
toadied to&mdash;because his people have money. He knows
that if he didn&#8217;t have a rich father, mamma and Sylvia
wouldn&#8217;t think any more of him than Lary does. He&#8217;d
take me away from that house to-day, if he had his way
about it. He knows what I&#8217;m in for ... Sylvia to
order me around for a month. I almost wish mamma
hadn&#8217;t gone to Bromfield.&#8221;</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>For a day or two Eileen was abstracted and moody, a
flaccid resignation taking the place of the high spiritual
enthusiasm that ushered in her surrender. But it was
not in the girl&#8217;s nature to remain long depressed. She
could not, as Lavinia did, nurture a grouch to its final
fruition. Her return to normal was accompanied by a
sequence of quarrels with her elder sister, and she shunned
her father with studied aversion. Hal resumed his
old habit of asking her to meet him on the campus or
around the corner on Sherman Avenue. &#8220;To escape
Sylvia&#8217;s sticky patronage,&#8221; she explained to Mrs. Ascott.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the week she went with Theodora
to the shady west porch of Vine Cottage, to assist with
the drawing of innumerable threads and the hemming of
a fresh supply of napkins for the two linen closets. Her
lap was overflowing with damask when the postman&#8217;s
whistle shrilled through the sultry morning air. Theo
bounded to her feet, her eyes wide with excitement.
The coming of the postman was always an adventure,
vicarious but none the less interesting. Some day he
might bring.... No, she was not expecting letters for
herself. But Lary had sent away a poem and an essay.
And then, there ought to be a long letter for daddy. As
yet there had been nothing but a stingy post card, with
the hackneyed old Niagara Falls on one side and on the
other that offensive old cliché: &#8220;Will write soon.&#8221; And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mamma had sent such attractive cards to all the others,
not omitting Nanny and Mrs. Dutton.</p>

<p>After a few minutes she came slowly back, all the joy
gone out of her face. There was a long envelope addressed
to Mr. Larimore Trench. She inverted the
hateful thing in Judith&#8217;s lap. Letters of acceptance did
not come in long envelopes. There was another one,
square and perfumed, bearing the name, Mrs. Raoul
Ascott. Who was this Raoul Ascott, that he should intrude
here?</p>

<p>She had read the stanza in the back of one of Sylvia&#8217;s
books ... written while Sylvia was temporarily engrossed
with a young professor whose spouse had died.
But, after all, it wasn&#8217;t quite fair to feel that way about
people who couldn&#8217;t help being remembered. And Mr.
Ascott <i>had</i> vacated the place that belonged rightfully to
Lary. The third letter was from mamma. It bore,
in Lavinia&#8217;s cramped writing, the name of Mrs. Oliver
Penrose. The little girl raged impotently as she called
her sister.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Sylvia pushed Eileen none too gently aside, to make
room for herself in the hammock beside Mrs. Ascott.
Then she fell upon her letter, reading aloud such passages
as involved no violation of the family&#8217;s privacy.
The journey had been hot and dusty&mdash;not a familiar
face on the train from beginning to end. Theodore had
met her in Rochester with the new car, and she had enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the first part of the ride, along the Genesee. She
was glad Ellen was not along. It gave Ted a chance to
tell her ever so many things, that she would otherwise
not have heard.</p>

<p>Ellen could think of nothing but the Stone scandal.
Everybody felt sorry for Calvin. For her part, she
thought he got only what he deserved. She had not seen
him, as yet. His life was a terrible example of the consequences
of sin. She hoped he had not forgotten how
she tried for years to lead him into the church. She
might remind him of this, when she saw him ... for
Ellen had invited him&mdash;oh, much against her own wishes&mdash;to
have dinner with them Sunday.</p>

<p>As Sylvia read, the long envelope addressed to Mr.
Larimore Trench slipped from Judith&#8217;s lap and fell to
the floor. Eileen stooped to restore it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee-oo! Lary&#8217;ll be down in the back cellar, eating
coal to warm his heart,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;It certainly does
take the tuck out of him to have the editors give him the
back-fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine what you mean,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott smiled,
&#8220;but you are wrong in your surmise. This is not a rejected
manuscript. It is a business letter from one of
my attorneys&mdash;not Mr. Ramsay.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That evening, just as Hal and Eileen were driving
away in the little roadster, with Sylvia watching them
from a third-floor window, Lary sprang nimbly over the
wall and hurried to the summer house, the long envelope
in his hand. His feet scarce touched the grass ... he
walked like Theodora in her most charming mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the contract for the plans. I couldn&#8217;t wait to
let you know. It might have been the other thing. I
wouldn&#8217;t let myself see how eager I was for ... success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Mr. Sanderson says they are charmed with the
whole arrangement. They want me to come to New
York at once for a conference. His daughter doesn&#8217;t
care about the cow barn&mdash;since she isn&#8217;t operating a
dairy. They would like to have me substitute a studio,
somewhere out in the woods. It appears that the bride-to-be
is a sculptor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she and Hilda Travers were in Paris together&mdash;but
of course you don&#8217;t know about Hilda.&#8221;</p>

<p>A queer, chilly feeling crept over Judith Ascott. She
had forgotten Hilda. She had forgotten everything.
It all belonged to another world, a story she had read
in a book on an idle summer&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t&mdash;let the Marksleys have the cow barn?&#8221;
she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t. A lower nature than yours
would have taken a mean revenge&mdash;by letting the dwelling
of cattle shame the manor house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that, Judith. They offered me a stiff price
for that one set of plans, and I needed the money. But
... seeing anything of mine in that environment of
cairngorms would make me feel the way it does to see
Eileen running around with that&mdash;&#8221; He checked himself,
and the slow red&mdash;Lavinia&#8217;s red that betokened
impotent rage&mdash;crept above the line of his collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are they going to begin building? The Sandersons,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Immediately. They want me to go over the ground
and outline the landscape features. I shall probably be
back and forth the rest of the summer. They have
asked me to serve in the capacity of supervising architect.
We don&#8217;t do things that way in Springdale. But I have
helped my father&mdash;long before I was out of college&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
I have all the necessary experience. The only difference
is that Mr. Sanderson will pay me a fee and flaunt my
name on sign-boards all over the estate. I may as well
get used to that part of it. I have always insisted that
my father use his name, as contractor, in connection with
the actual work. It&#8217;s a distinction I never relished.
But if I&#8217;m going to invade the New York field&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy. Have you told Sylvia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I told the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was dear, Lary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Larimore Trench turned to look at her. The blue-grey
eyes were suffused and the sweet lips trembled.
The man wondered why he had no impulse to kiss so
engaging a mouth. It was all spiritual, that strange
contact that he was experiencing for the first time in his
life. Then, too, kissing had always been associated with
his mother, the outward symbol of a bond he knew did
not exist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going down to the office to talk it over with papa.
They have asked for an immediate answer by wire. It
is not necessary to tell you what the answer will be.
Won&#8217;t you come with me? I&#8217;ll turn the electric fan on
you while we talk shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lary, won&#8217;t I be horribly in the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could the other half of me be in the way? Don&#8217;t
you see, dear, you must be with me when my father has
the proudest moment of his life. This will be the antidote
for all that Marksley poison in his soul.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXI &nbsp; The Cloud on the Horizon</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>That night Theodora wrote a long letter to her
mother. It was devoted almost wholly to Lary&#8217;s
triumph. The following week the Bromfield Sentinel
heralded on its front page the news of Mr. Larimore
Trench&#8217;s latest artistic success. The florid paragraph
hinted of other successes. One must not infer that the
designing of a New York millionaire&#8217;s country home was
a novel experience to the brilliant young architect, whose
parents were natives of Bromfield. The item ended with
the announcement that Mrs. David Trench was a guest
in the home of her brother, &#8220;the Honourable T. J. Larimore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! we&#8217;d better confiscate this thing before Lary
sees it,&#8221; Eileen ejaculated. &#8220;Mamma always could pull
the long bow; but she pretty near overshot herself this
time. You&#8217;d think Lary was a corporation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would Sylvia be vexed?&#8221; Judith asked. Sylvia was
out riding with Dr. Schubert when the garrulous sheet
left the postman&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... because it smacks of the small town. She
hasn&#8217;t any better taste than mamma has. It wouldn&#8217;t
jolt her the way it would Lary or papa. Lady Judith,
I used to cringe and sweat blood when Hal said crass
things before Lary. Now it doesn&#8217;t matter what my
brother thinks. I want to shout Hal from the house-tops.
I don&#8217;t care who knows that we love each other,
and that we have broken all the silly shackles that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
stodgy civilization thinks are so important. Papa dislikes
him because he isn&#8217;t the Sunday school kind, and
Lary says he&#8217;s crude and common. Well, just the way
he is ... is exactly right for me. I&#8217;m no Dresden
china shepherdess, myself. How would I feel, marrying
a man who couldn&#8217;t stand for a little slang&mdash;or expressing
your real feelings, now and then? With such a
man as Lary or Syd Schubert, I&#8217;d be a fish out of water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure you are a fish?&#8221; Judith asked
searchingly. &#8220;Did it ever occur to you, my dear, that
you have been in the water with Hal until you fancy
yourself a fish of his kind? Aren&#8217;t you afraid that you&#8217;ll
be tossed up on the bank some day, a little drowned
bird?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No!&#8221; Eileen screamed, her cheeks blanching.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t take all the glory, all the wonder out of it.
Don&#8217;t you understand that I am free? You talk about
slave-women. Men don&#8217;t make slaves of them. It is
their own selfishness that chains them. I wish I could
pour out my heart to you ... make you see it as I do.
Not the sordid thing that love usually is&mdash;Sylvia&#8217;s love
for Oliver, that pays for a swell apartment and a bundle
of gaudy rags. I want to be free, and I want to show
other women the light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, dear girl,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott cried in alarm,
&#8220;you are only sixteen. You haven&#8217;t even the rudiments
of the system you are trying to teach. Can&#8217;t you get
your feet on solid ground and stay there until you are
a few years older? I was wrong when I suggested water.
You are up in the clouds. If I thought it would serve
to deter you from this madness, Eileen, I would open for
you the darkest chapter of my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know ... already. I heard mamma telling papa
that you were divorced&mdash;that you tried to get even with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
your husband by running away with another man. It
was contemptible of me to listen; but I did it because I
wanted to see how bad she would make it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith Ascott&#8217;s face flamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And papa was quiet a long time&mdash;and then he said
that there were some people who could touch pitch and
not be defiled. When he said that&mdash;it got me by the
heart, and I made a little gurgling noise in my throat.
I was sure they heard me. But mamma flared back at
him so furiously that I was half way down the stairs
before they came out of their room. That was several
weeks ago&mdash;a few days after you told her. And I wondered
how it would affect him&mdash;towards you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning at breakfast, he said you were the
purest, noblest woman he had met in years. And Theo
and Lary and I all raised such a chorus of approval
that mamma ran out to the kitchen to tell Drusilla that
the waffles were tough.&#8221;</p>

<p>An arm stole around the girl&#8217;s waist. What had
come over Judith Ascott, that she should care ... that
David Trench&#8217;s approval should mean so much? But
Eileen misunderstood. In a sudden burst of confidence,
she whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take care of the wedding ring, along with
the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are married!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we are going to be, before Hal leaves for
college. We finally decided ... last night. Then I
am going to him as soon as he is settled in Brooklyn.
Of course his mother must not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t do this, you poor, infatuated
child. Give Hal the advantage of a little perspective.
Look at him when he comes home for the holidays. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
isn&#8217;t a summer romance&mdash;or a drama, to be disposed
of in the fourth act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what if he saw some girl in Brooklyn he liked
better than me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you couldn&#8217;t possibly hold him&mdash;if you were
ten times married. That is just the danger. You and
Hal will almost surely grow apart when you are removed
from identical influences. A year from now you may
detest him, and he is more than likely to lose interest in
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eileen sprang up and ran stumbling from the room.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>When she returned, an hour later, her eyes were red
and swollen from crying. She went straight to the telephone
and took down the receiver. She wanted Hal to
come to Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s home at once. When the youth
had yielded reluctant assent, she threw herself down on
the window seat to wait.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to have an adjustment,&#8221; she cried passionately.
&#8220;It can&#8217;t go on this way. I was so sure of
my ground ... and every word you said was ... just
one puncture after another. I could fairly feel the tires
sagging under me. Once I was on the point of writing
to mamma. She&#8217;s the only one who agrees with me about
Hal. Even Sylvia has been throwing cold water on me,
the last day or two. Says I could do better&mdash;and I
ought to go around with the other boys to show him I
don&#8217;t care. I won&#8217;t be a liar. I do care!&#8221;</p>

<p>When young Marksley came into Mrs. Ascott&#8217;s presence,
there was a shamed droop to his shoulders and he
was plainly embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal, I have told her everything,&#8221; Eileen began.
&#8220;Now I want you to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;You little fool!&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith Ascott sprang to her feet, but the youth was already
striving to cover his blunder by an avalanche of
apology. The expression was out of his mouth before
he had time to think. He was shocked that Eileen
should betray a secret they had sworn to keep. He
hadn&#8217;t meant to be rude. He was stunned by her treachery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we aren&#8217;t married yet. I only told her we
intended to be&mdash;and wanted her to witness the ceremony,
before you leave for college.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hal Marksley&#8217;s chest collapsed in a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get ready to be married, Mrs. Ascott, we&#8217;ll
talk it over with you. Now, Eileen, run home and get
your motor bonnet. I have to drive to Olive Hill on
an errand for father. I left my car around the corner.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>At the side door of the Trench home, the girl had a
sharp tilt with her sister, who had come back from the
ride in time to see&mdash;and interpret&mdash;the tear-stained face.
Sylvia would write to her mother. She would not continue
to sponsor a love affair for a girl who had no sense.
She would not play chaperone at long range. If Hal had
any breeding, he would invite her to go with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the rub!&#8221; Eileen sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t the rub&mdash;and I might have known you
wouldn&#8217;t appreciate anything I tried to do for you. If
you keep on, the way you&#8217;re going, you&#8217;ll have Hal so
sick and tired of you that he&#8217;ll be glad to get out of reach
of the telephone. I tried to make you a little indifferent
to him&mdash;and got insolence for my pains. If you had a
grain of policy, you wouldn&#8217;t let him see that you are
daft about him. That&#8217;s no way to hold a man&#8217;s love. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
kept Syd Schubert dangling at my belt for four years by
letting him half way think I cared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and you lost Tom Henderson by the same tactics.
Tom wanted whole hog or none, and you didn&#8217;t get
on to the fact till he&#8217;d got sick of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, for heaven&#8217;s sake, use such vulgar expressions.
Hal is such a gentleman, I don&#8217;t see how he stands you.
Eileen, I wish you would see that I am doing this for
your own good&mdash;and to please mamma. I have had experience,
and I know what works with a man, nine times
out of ten. I&#8217;ll hold Oliver Penrose to the end of the
world ... by keeping him guessing. Look at the way
mamma has kept papa on his knees for nearly twenty-eight
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think that a fine thing?&#8221; the girl flared. &#8220;If
you pattern your life after mamma&#8217;s, at her age you&#8217;ll be
as hard and cruel&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You outrageous, you impudent&mdash;&#8221; Words failed.
&#8220;How do you dare speak that way about your parents?
And Theo&#8217;s almost as bad. At your age, I never
dreamed of being disrespectful, or saying a word back
when mamma reproved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sylvia, come off! Mamma says she never talked
back to her mother. And then she forgets, and tells the
impudent things she used to say&mdash;and how her grandmother
Larimore took her part against all the rest of
the family. But there&#8217;s Hal, tooting his horn for me.
I&#8217;ll ask him to invite you to ride with us some evening
next week. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be charmed!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXII &nbsp; Midsummer Magic</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Life moved on another fortnight, with little to vary
the monotony of motor rides, luncheons, and irritating
disputes, and all at once Sylvia&#8217;s reason for prolonging
her visit in Springdale was removed. Lavinia Trench
came home! She startled the girls by driving up to
the gate in Hafferty&#8217;s lumbering old cab, her trunk toppling
precariously on the driver&#8217;s seat and her trim body
hemmed in between boxes and travelling bags. A letter
that had arrived that very morning announced that she
would yield to Ellen&#8217;s pleading that she remain another
week&mdash;unless she were greatly needed at home.</p>

<p>Without waiting for the ceremony of the bath and a
change of raiment, she hurried to Vine Cottage to present
the souvenir she had brought from Rochester. Judith
forgot to thank her, so amazed was she by the astounding
change in the woman&#8217;s countenance. Such a
change she had witnessed in her garden when Dutton,
with hoe and fine-toothed rake, had obliterated the ridges
and hummocks of his spading. All that had been Lavinia
was gone. It was not that she looked girlish, rejuvenated.
In the past few months she had made many
swift changes from youth to age&mdash;had rebounded from
dank depression to hysterical buoyancy. This change
was different. It was, in fact, as if Lavinia had lent her
body to some other woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stay a minute,&#8221; she fluttered. &#8220;My precious
old sweetheart is coming home early, and he thinks no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
one can cook chicken the way I can. You ought to have
heard him when I called him on the &#8217;phone, a minute ago.
I thought he&#8217;d let the receiver fall, he was so astonished
... and pleased.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>During the next few days Judith forgot Eileen, well-nigh
forgot Lary, in her perplexed contemplation of their
mother. Some thaumaturge, endowed with more than
a magician&#8217;s power, must have his habitation in Bromfield.
The most audacious quack would guarantee no
such cure of a sick body and a doubly sick mind in four
short weeks. Lavinia had subtracted twenty years from
her normal age, as neatly as a reptile discards an outworn
skin. Her step was short and vigorous, with none
of the stumping determination that so long marked it.
Her head was carried high and the black eyes beamed
with amiability. The very quality of her voice had undergone
change. She no longer swung from cloying
sweetness to acrid outbursts. More than all else, a half
gentleness&mdash;that she still wore uncomfortably, like a fur
cloak in August&mdash;held her family in puzzled wonder.</p>

<p>David moved as one walking in his sleep. He was
afraid to breathe, lest he fall to earth and awaken to the
old barren reality. When it appeared likely that the
mood would remain, he accepted the goods the gods had
provided. He had waited long, and the reward was
justly his.</p>

<p>One evening Theodora sought her Lady Judith. She
was agitated to the point of inarticulateness. Her little
brown face was drawn with fear and two red spots
burned in the thin cheeks. Twice, thrice she essayed to
speak, her throat swelling and her bird-like eyes darting
their mute appeal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&#8220;Might I&mdash;might I sit in your lap?&#8221; she faltered at
last. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so very heavy, and I can&#8217;t tell you unless
I.... I have to tell you in your ear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you afraid of, dearie?&#8221; Mrs. Ascott
snuggled her close.</p>

<p>&#8220;It happened just a few minutes ago&mdash;and&mdash;I know I
didn&#8217;t dream it. It was when Papa came downstairs
from changing his clothes. You know, they are going
to the reception for the Board of Trustees, and my
daddy looked so handsome when he came in the library&mdash;with
a pink carnation in his buttonhole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There they go, now. Don&#8217;t you want to wave good-bye
to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to interrupt mamma. They don&#8217;t
know I&#8217;m on earth. That&#8217;s what I came to tell you
about. You see that mamma has on the yellow organdie
dress. But you don&#8217;t know what that means&mdash;signifies,&#8221;
she amended, weighing the word with unaccustomed deliberation.
&#8220;Papa bought it for her, at a big store
in St. Louis, when she was going away. And she was so
hateful&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t put it on, or even take it with her.
And to-night she said she was glad she&#8217;d saved it&mdash;just
for him&mdash;because it was the prettiest dress she ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad she said that, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but that wasn&#8217;t all she said. She noticed that
he picked a pink carnation, when everybody knows my
daddy prefers red ones. I was sitting in the window
niche, reading a book. Goodness knows, I was in plain
sight. And they didn&#8217;t either one of them see me.
Mamma came in first, talking to herself about how pretty
her dress was ... and how happy she was....&#8221;
Theodora&#8217;s breath came short, and the black eyes were
luminous with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, Lady Judith, all at once my daddy came in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
room, and he tiptoed up behind her and cuddled her
under the chin with his fingers. And she wheeled around
and just nestled in his arms, like a kitten. And then she
kissed him&mdash;the way you do when you just <i>adore</i> anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice sank to an awed whisper. Judith clasped
the frail body, with its consuming emotional fire, her own
heart pounding with vicarious passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she looked up in his eyes and told him he was the
best man in the world, a million times handsomer and
more successful than any man among their old friends.
And she wanted to go back, on their anniversary, the first
of November, to let all those silly people see for themselves
what a fine man he had turned out to be. And
papa looked as if he wanted to laugh and cry, at the same
time, and his face was as beautiful as an angel&#8217;s, he was
so happy. And I&#8217;m afraid my mamma is&mdash;going to&mdash;di-i-ie!&#8221;
The voice broke in an agony of sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, precious. She is just beginning to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>What had wrought the miracle? The absence that
makes the heart grow fond? But Mrs. Trench had
often been away from home and family, and it was certain
that none of her former home-comings had had such
sequential consummation. Had she, for some unfathomable
reason, perceived David as he was? Had
she fallen in love with her husband?</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>August was a glorious month for the circle that revolved
around Vine Cottage. Eileen had been wooed
by her mother to confession of her secret engagement,
and David had given reluctant consent. He was too
deeply steeped in his own belated bliss to deny any other
human creature the benison of happiness. Hal would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
be leaving for Brooklyn the second week in September,
and it was only right that the two young people should
spend all their evenings together.</p>

<p>Occasionally they went across the street for a musical
feast with Mrs. Nims&mdash;whom society was accepting,
since it had been noised abroad that only three lives stood
between her and a peerage. More often they explored
strange highways beneath the starlight. Lary, at home
for brief periods, viewed the situation with equanimity.
He had made many compromises, and this was only a
little more galling than some of the others. He found
a modicum of compensation in his father&#8217;s sweet content,
and in his mother&#8217;s almost pathetic devotion to
the woman who had rounded out his own being.</p>

<p>&#8220;She quotes you on every possible occasion,&#8221; he told
Judith. &#8220;If you advised her to forswear the moral code,
she would obey you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fearsome responsibility,&#8221; the woman averred.
&#8220;What if I should blunder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t make her any less happy than she was
when you came. She says you are better medicine than
anything Dr. Schubert ever prescribed. And she insists
it was you who compelled her to go to Bromfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary, you must have read a story&mdash;I don&#8217;t recall the
title&mdash;one of Pierre Loti&#8217;s exotic conceits ... the
faithless lover who was tormented by remorse until
he went back to Constantinople and spent a night on the
grave of the woman he had wronged. Do you think
some fancy of your mother&#8217;s girlhood has been dispelled
by her visit ... perhaps some illusion shattered by
crass reality?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to gauge my mother&mdash;now less
than ever before.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>When Lary had gone, Mrs. Trench slipped in at the
back door. She had been waiting her turn. It was like
the old Lavinia to know exactly what she wanted. And
again, it was like Lavinia to veil her request in mystery
and innuendo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask your advice. You know so much more
about the ways of the world than I do.&#8221; She drew from
the pocket of her muslin dress a thick letter. &#8220;Do you
think there are any circumstances under which it would
be right for a married woman to receive&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so naïve, Judith could with difficulty repress
a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I write a good many letters to my attorney, Mr.
Ramsay. He has a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But those are business letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always. I write to him when I am blue or in
doubt. His wife detests letter-writing. She usually
adds a postscript.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She sees the letters&mdash;and replies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to be sure. You mean, Mrs. Trench, the kind
of letters a woman could not show her husband? I&#8217;m
afraid that is never quite safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ignored the first&mdash;and the second. This one came
on Friday. And then the minister preached that sermon
on regeneration through suffering. He said it was
our duty to help God to chastise the wayward soul.
This man ... the one who wrote to me....&#8221; She
faltered, then went on resolutely: &#8220;He is very unhappy.
It is a man I met on the train&mdash;and he fell in love with
me. Of course I repulsed him. I told him what a splendid
husband I had. And in this letter he says that when
I praised David to him&mdash;on the train&mdash;it was all he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
do to keep from carrying me off bodily&mdash;it threw him into
such a jealous rage. I ought to be furious with him.&#8221;
She stared into vacancy, adding slowly: &#8220;but I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>

<p>This new Lavinia had suddenly come upon some bewildering
apparition. Her fingers twitched, and a yellow
pallor drank up the flush in her rounded cheeks. A
chance acquaintance on a railroad train! Eileen might
have fallen beneath the glamour of such a romance. But
for a woman of Mrs. Trench&#8217;s age and temperament!
It was unthinkable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott, tell me ... do people ever really get
over things?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the fire of her being leaped to her eyes as she put
the question, leaving her face ghastly. It was as if
her whole life hung on the answer.</p>


<p>&#8220;Sorrow and disappointment? Oh, I am sure they
do. And, my dear Mrs. Trench, I wouldn&#8217;t lay too
much stress on the infatuation of a man you met in the
Pullman. To write to him&mdash;letters you couldn&#8217;t show
your husband&mdash;might be followed by serious complications.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I have character&mdash;stability enough
to&mdash;you won&#8217;t say anything about this to Larimore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely not.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>That evening David and Lavinia went out to sprinkle
the vegetable garden, their arms around each other&#8217;s
waists, their attitude that of a honeymoon pair. When
the task was done they came to the summer house for an
hour&#8217;s visit. Not even Hal and Eileen, in the first fever
of their revealed engagement, were more frankly devoted
than they. It seemed to Judith, sitting with them,
that the woman was the aggressor, that she multiplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
endearing terms and half-concealed caresses, to assure
herself that she truly felt what her lips were saying.
For David these manifestations were unnecessary. His
whole being was a caress.</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>August passed, and the first hot days of September&mdash;their
discomfort forgotten in the excitement of Eileen&#8217;s
entrance into college. There was yet another week before
Hal must depart for his examinations, and on Thursday
evening he failed to report, either in person or by
telephone. The omission elicited no comment. But
when the week had slipped by, and it became known that
the youth had departed for New York without calling to
say good-bye, Lavinia made bold to question her
daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he didn&#8217;t want to come, I&#8217;m sure nobody was going
to ask him,&#8221; the girl flung back, her eyes darkening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear. These little quarrels only prove
that it is true love. You and Hal will make it all up in
your letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t going to be any letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>After her mother had gone into the house, Theodora
drew near the hammock where Eileen had been studying
Christian Ethics, squinting her burning eyes as the daylight
waned, striving to focus her mind on the empty
paragraphs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you and Hal quarrel about? Go on&mdash;tell
me,&#8221; the child teased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out and let me alone. Don&#8217;t you know any better
than to interrupt a fellow who has to bone freshman
ethics? I almost had a philosophic thought by the tail,
when you butted in on my painful ratiocinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to pry, Eileen. Honest, I don&#8217;t. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
you&#8217;ve cried every night since Wednesday. And when
you talked in your sleep, last night&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221; The girl sat up, sending the textbook flying
across the lawn. &#8220;What did I say? Tell me every
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d been kind of mumbling, and all at once you
said right out loud: &#8216;Hal Marksley, to think I could have
loved a dirty calf like you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say &#8216;calf&#8217;&mdash;I said&mdash;&#8221; She clapped her hand
to her mouth and her cheeks went white. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
have a separate room. That&#8217;s all there is about it. If
I can&#8217;t keep from babbling in my sleep....&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXIII &nbsp; Lavinia Sees the Abyss</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Four days without incident ... and then Eileen
fainted at the dressmaker&#8217;s. The afternoon was hot and
she had stood for a long fitting. It was nothing unusual
to the seamstress, but it was a thrilling experience for
the girl who had never known oblivion other than that of
normal sleep. She went home with a bump on her head,
to tell how near she came to being impaled on Miss Denison&#8217;s
shears. Saturday morning she fainted again. It
was after a long telephone conversation with Kitten Henderson.
Lavinia sent for Dr. Schubert. He was making
a country call. In a panic of fear she summoned
Mrs. Ascott. When they had chafed the girl&#8217;s hands
and bathed her temples with brandy, consciousness returned
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I was dying,&#8221; she murmured between stiffened
lips. &#8220;My hands felt like clubs, and all at once
my whole body seemed to be climbing into my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry&mdash;the sudden baffled scream of a trapped animal&mdash;burst
from Lavinia Trench, as she sprang to the side
of the divan. &#8220;What have you done? Oh, my God,
what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mrs. Trench,&#8221; Judith expostulated, &#8220;what
has come over you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what it means. You haven&#8217;t been
through it six times. I never fainted at any other time&mdash;and
that scapegrace of a Hal Marksley off to college
without a word. Oh, I&#8217;ll go mad!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Relief came in a torrential flood of abuse, of self-pity.
All the store that had been repressed since the early days
of July poured its acrid waters over the girl. In vain
Eileen sought to defend herself, to declare furiously that
her mother&#8217;s accusation was untrue. In such moods,
Lavinia was never careful to choose her words. When
the tirade became insulting, beyond endurance, she sprang
from the couch and fled to a room on the third floor
where she could lock herself in and defy the family to
drag her forth.</p>

<p>Judith went home, dumb with anguish. Would Eileen
do violence to herself? Would David&#8217;s heart break?
Would Lary.... She paused, panting, to frame the
question: &#8220;Would Lary rise to the occasion?&#8221; On the
answer hung all her hope. After an hour of thinking,
such as she had never done before, she went again
through the wicket gate. She would take the girl with
her for the laboratory experiment&mdash;an unusually important
one, that called for an extra pair of hands. Lavinia
was nowhere in sight; but from the cellar came the
sound of mop and broom. Absinthe might give surcease
to the roué in the boulevard restaurant but for Lavinia
Trench the safety-valve was hard manual labor.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The experiment, that morning, narrowly missed success.
At the moment when three pairs of eyes were
watching with anxious interest, the fumes from a heated
retort were wafted into Eileen&#8217;s face, and she collapsed
in Dr. Schubert&#8217;s arms. Judith turned off the flame beneath
the mass of glowing coal and hurried to the consultation
room where the girl lay, white and deathlike.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unfasten her corsets, quick! Her pulse is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
gone.&#8221; The physician&#8217;s command held an unwonted
blend of terror. Eileen Trench was the core of his
soul. He could not be impersonal, where she was concerned.
At an opportune moment Sydney arrived, to
lend a hand.</p>

<p>It was decided that the girl must lie quiet for an hour.
And of course Mrs. Ascott would stop for luncheon.
Luncheon! Could one eat food, with the world in shambles?
She went to the divan, choking with distress.
The amber eyes were half closed and great tears welled
over the lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beastly to be such a nuisance to those we
love....&#8221; The blue lips scarcely moved to articulate
the poignantly empty words. Then the long lashes
drooped in utter weariness, and Eileen slept.</p>

<p>Judith Ascott left the office. She wanted to get away
from herself, away from every familiar thing. Unconsciously
she turned her back on the cross-street that
would have led to the campus and thence to her home.
How many miles she walked, she could not guess. She
was hazily conscious of smiling meadows and orchards,
panting beneath their load of ruddy fruit. Winding
hill roads, ankle-deep in dust, and brooks that laughed
at obstructing pebbles; pastures where cattle grazed, and
acres of coreopsis, resplendent with their wealth of fleeting
gold, she viewed with eyes that saw not.</p>

<p>When at last her strength waned and hunger overcame
her, she perceived that she was approaching a town. She
would go to the station and inquire for a train to Springdale.
A little way to her left, graders were at work with
shovels that scarred the helpless earth. Great piles of
stone and other piles of yellow brick and moulded terra
cotta crowned the rising ground. In the midst of all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
orderly confusion she perceived a sign-board, insolent
with new paint:</p>

<p class="center">DAVID TRENCH<br />
BUILDING CONTRACTOR</p>

<p>She stared in astonishment. Then, by some magic of
the mind the solid earth beneath her feet shifted. She
was no longer facing south. This was Springdale, and
she was approaching her home from the west. The work
on Henry Marksley&#8217;s mansion had already begun. She
shuddered as she thought of David.</p>

<p>From the high point in the parked boulevard, near
which the sign-board stood, she could see the distant
tower clock, its face gilded by the late afternoon sun.
And over there on the newly paved extension of Sherman
Avenue the foolish little trolley car was bobbing serenely
along. She could catch it on the return trip if she hurried.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">XXIV &nbsp; One Way Out</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Early Sunday morning Mrs. Trench came to the back
door, brushed Nanny aside as if her redundant bulk had
been a wisp of grass in the path, crossed the immaculate
kitchen, and climbed the rear stairs. She knew that the
mistress of Vine Cottage was having breakfast in her
bedroom, and the ultimate degree of privacy was
necessary. She was no longer the gentle Lavinia of
those seven charmed weeks. All the softness had vanished
from her countenance, and her voice was flinty as
she spoke. There was no need of mincing words. Mrs.
Ascott was in the secret, and she might as well know the
worst. Eileen was guilty. There was no excuse and no
help for it. She had confessed the whole thing to her
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been afraid from the first that she was in
danger. She is too young to discriminate, and she was
madly in love. Have you told her brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was lucky for Larimore that that dog of
a Hal Marksley was safe out of town. There would
have been murder, and another scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David! He makes me sick. He sits and stares at
the carpet as if he&#8217;d been turned to stone. Oh, why did
I marry such a dolt! If he would only whip her&mdash;anything
to show that he is a man! Mrs. Ascott, you
are a woman of the world. You have had affairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
your own, and have got through them unscathed. Can&#8217;t
you help me? Don&#8217;t you see that I am distracted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may count on me for anything I can do,&#8221; Judith
told her coldly.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>When the heavy Sunday dinner was over, and Drusilla
had gone out for the afternoon, Lary and Theodora
walked hand in hand to the shop behind the vegetable
garden. A minute later, Judith saw the child flitting
across the alley in the direction of the Stevens home.
She knew that now Larimore Trench would come to her.</p>

<p>Her heart stood still and all her senses swam.</p>

<p>When, after an interminable period of waiting&mdash;how
stupid the clock that measures our travail by its rigid
tape of minutes!&mdash;the man stood before her, she saw
that his face was white with grief and his hands shook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to come to us? All the manhood has
gone out of me. I can&#8217;t go through it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Lary.&#8221; And they crossed the lawn together.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>The library blinds were drawn and the room was hot
and still. Eileen lay back in the chaise longue, her eyes
half closed, her lips pouting surlily. Her father paced
the floor, his blue eyes lost in shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott,&#8221; he began in a choked voice, &#8220;you know
the pitiful thing that has come upon us. You have been
a good neighbour, and we come to you for advice. We
are simple people, and my wife feels that you....&#8221; He
finished the sentence with his deep, appealing eyes. &#8220;I
wanted to go to Mr. Marksley and insist that his son
make restitution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Lavinia screamed, the remnant of her self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
tearing to tatters as she looked at her daughter,
&#8220;and that idiot of a girl threatening to kill herself if we
go a step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be married to any man at the point of a gun&mdash;as
long as there is a river in Springdale where people
can be drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a mortal sin to take your own life,&#8221; her father
pleaded. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t face your God with such a
crime on your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes to a choice between facing God and
you people&mdash;I&#8217;d take my chances with God any day.
If I have committed the unpardonable sin, I don&#8217;t see
how marrying Hal Marksley would make it any better.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright and her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is right? What is sin? You would hound a
woman to death because she has a child without being
tied body and soul to a man she despises. Hal&#8217;s mother
and father hate each other ... and look at their children.
There isn&#8217;t one of them that&#8217;s fit to live. Look
at us. We are another family of misfits. And why?
Mamma hates papa, lets him follow her around like a
hungry dog begging for a bone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You insolent girl!&#8221; Lavinia gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know anything about love&mdash;and what it
means to come into the world all warped and out of tune.
Do you imagine that I am going to tie myself to a cad&mdash;let
him be responsible for other children of mine?
There isn&#8217;t any fidelity in a man who is born of hate. If
you knew what a contemptible pup he is, you&#8217;d see why
the river looks better to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have thought of that, before&mdash;&#8221; David
offered gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know him till it was too late.&#8221; She relaxed
ever so little. &#8220;We had talked it all over, and he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the most advanced ideas. But when it came to facing
the music.... Bah! I despise a man who whimpers.
<i>He was afraid of his mother.</i> I could have stood even
that. But when he wanted to take me to Sutton, to a
doctor he said was in the habit of helping those factory
girls out of their scrapes ... I slapped him; I beat
him with my two fists; I spit in his face. I told him that
if he was not a man, I would take the consequences
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused to gather breath, her cheeks burning, her
gaze detached. She was living over again that monstrous
cataclysm. &#8220;He tried to defend himself by saying
I had no right to disgrace his family. Imagine!
Disgrace Henry Marksley and Adelaide Nims! I told
him I wasn&#8217;t going through life with murder on my soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you told him that, daughter,&#8221; David said,
his eyes warming.</p>

<p>Judith Ascott crossed the room and laid a hand protectingly
on Eileen&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;May I offer a solution?
You have asked me to use my wits. I know of a case&mdash;not
unlike this one&mdash;a young girl who made the same
blunder. She had a married sister who had no child.
Among all their friends, I am the only one who knows
that the splendid little boy is not that sister&#8217;s child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&mdash;how was it managed?&#8221; Lavinia&#8217;s practical
mind demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;They went together to a sanitarium, where not even
the superintendent knew which was the wife of the man
whose name the baby was to bear. I should suggest
sending at once for Sylvia. She and Eileen could&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never work in the world!&#8221; Lavinia exploded.
&#8220;Oliver detests children. He won&#8217;t let Sylvia have one
of her own&mdash;even if she wanted it. And he&#8217;d leave her
... if he knew there was such a disgrace in the family.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Eileen said with bitter scorn, &#8220;he was born in
Salem, where they put scarlet letters on women who sin.
I guess it&#8217;s the river for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another way,&#8221; Judith cried, defiant and exultant.
&#8220;I can take the baby for my own. I will go
away with you, until it&#8217;s over, and you can come back
alone, with nobody to know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&#8221; Lavinia Trench stood up, her eyes
wild, her throat swelling&mdash;&#8220;you mean, marry Larimore
and palm the child off as his?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;if no other way can be found. We could go
to New York, where the building of the Sanderson home
would provide the necessary explanation. Eileen might
take lessons from Professor Auersbach for several
months. She could come home in a year. I would not
return until a child in my arms would cause no remark.&#8221;</p>

<p>David moved to her side and pressed his lips reverently
to her brow. &#8220;Daughter,&#8221; he murmured, his eyes
overflowing.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>That evening Lary came to the summer house.
There was a crescent moon and the air was heavy with
the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you make this sacrifice for me,&#8221; he began
huskily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sacrifice? Oh, my darling.... I have been so hungry
for you. I could cry for joy that Eileen has opened
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, my heart went cold when she said what she
did about the children of hate. Are you willing to trust
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You born of hate? Lary, Lary ... such love as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
your father&#8217;s ... the love that could survive twenty-eight
years of starvation!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gripped her hand until it hurt. Then he
drew her into his arms and his cheek rested against hers.
The young moon sank to sleep; the garden throbbed in
the velvet darkness; a moon-flower burst its bonds, just
above them, sending forth a shower of perfume.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too wonderful,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Judith, I
know the man that is in me. I have met him face to
face. I saw him reflected in your eyes, there in the
library. Now I shall never be alone. I have attained
the unattainable.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXV &nbsp; A Wedding at
Vine Cottage</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Monday morning found Eileen too ill to be out of bed.
Dr. Schubert came in response to an urgent request from
her father, looked at her tongue, felt her pulse, smiled
tolerantly ... and prescribed a nerve sedative. Later
in the day the girl who had twined her baby fingers about
the emotional center which in a man of science does duty
as a heart asserted her right to consideration. He went
home and talked it over with Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your intuition, boy. I can&#8217;t have her going to
pieces like this. She has always been free from hysteria&mdash;so
different from her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has had her first love affair&mdash;and Hal Marksley
is off to college.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sydney! That thick-lipped youth! Besides, Eileen is
only a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the day she was born, and you forget
the days between. I have been wretched over it all summer.
One night I met them, half way over to Greenville&mdash;the
night I was called to see the Hemple baby.
I spoke to Sylvia about it. And she reminded me of the
night&mdash;on that same road&mdash;when old Selim cast a shoe,
and we didn&#8217;t get home until almost morning. Once I
was on the point of taking it up with Lary; but he&#8217;s too
deeply in love to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary in love! Who&#8217;s the charmer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>&#8220;You dear old scientific abstraction. Have you had
Mrs. Ascott at your elbow four days a week&mdash;and do
you think a fellow with Lary&#8217;s temperament could spend
all his evenings with her, and escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&mdash;beautiful! But what about her ... a
woman who has exhausted New York and Paris? Would
she be satisfied with a simple nature like Lary&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary&#8217;s nature is about as simple in its refractions as
a rose diamond! Mrs. Ascott mothers him. I have
tried to make up that deficit in his life&mdash;but of course a
boy he grew up with couldn&#8217;t do it, as a sensitive woman
could. He knows I understand about Mrs. Ascott.
Oh, not that we have ever talked about it. That would
be too crude for Lary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are like your mother, boy. She spoke three
languages&mdash;and could dispense with all of them. But
we have gone miles from Eileen. I need your help,
desperately.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>While the two physicians discussed a disturbing case,
the one with understanding, the other blindly, a different
conversation was under way in Eileen&#8217;s bedroom. Mrs.
Trench had sent for Judith as soon as the coast was clear
of tale-bearers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&mdash;said this morning that he was going to take you
and Eileen with him when he goes to New York, Thursday
night. I thought we&#8217;d better lay out the details.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all so bald, so matter-of-fact. The woman
cringed, as from a desecration. She turned for relief to
the white face on the pillow. Mercurial tears glistened
in the dove-gray shadows that lurked beneath the swollen
eyes, and the mouth wore the old rebellious look.
Eileen was still smarting from the crass, polluting things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
her mother had said, after the physician&#8217;s departure.
She had brought this disgraceful thing on the family, and
Lavinia did not intend that she should shirk one minim
of her punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my part, I don&#8217;t see how you are going to hide
it by going to New York ... where everybody knows
you. All your friends will see at the first glance that
Larimore and Eileen are brother and sister. They look
exactly alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the compliment!&#8221; The girl tossed aside
the sheet and sat up. &#8220;We both have noses running
lengthwise of our faces, and mouths that cut across.
That&#8217;s all the resemblance you ever saw&mdash;when you were
telling me how handsome Lary was and how ugly I was.
I have it all figured out. I am going to be Lary&#8217;s cousin&mdash;young
Mrs. Winthrop, whose husband was lost on that
Alaska steamer that foundered two weeks ago. Ina and
I worked out the situation in a play we did last winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Ina will recognize your situation&mdash;and spread it
all over town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma! Please credit me with a little sense. This
story isn&#8217;t for home consumption. It&#8217;s for Judith&#8217;s
friends&mdash;when we get to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be few of them,&#8221; Mrs. Ascott interrupted.
&#8220;That danger is negligible. A few acquaintances at
Pelham and Larchmont. With the exception of my
father and the Ramsays, who live at Rye&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the neighbours!&#8221; Lavinia cried irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are none. We can go up and down in the
same lift with them for months without knowing what
they look like. New York is too self-absorbed to care
about any one&#8217;s happiness or misery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father!&#8221; the woman snapped. Her
triumph was short-lived.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&#8220;Papa could live in the same house with Eileen for a
year without knowing whether she was Miss Trench or
Mrs. Winthrop&mdash;Lary&#8217;s cousin or mine. He has forgotten
all but the outstanding facts of my life. As for
the Ramsays, they would take the situation as I do&mdash;if
it should become necessary to tell them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vine shook her head. She had no words with which
to express her disapproval of a city that could be thus
cold-bloodedly immoral. What sort of people were the
Ramsays, that one could tell them of a girl&#8217;s fall from
virtue without shocking them? What sort of woman was
Mrs. Ascott, that she could carry out such a wickedly
dishonest piece of business? Still, we must praise the
bridge that carries us over.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Lary stopped by on his way to the office after luncheon
to assure himself that it was not all an iridescent
dream. On him, too, Lavinia&#8217;s stolid acceptance of
Judith&#8217;s solution had a dampening effect. The rose had
been stripped of its blossoms and stood stark and thorny
before him. A few minutes of random talk, in which
each sought to sound the other&#8217;s depths, and then the
man said, as if it were an inconsequential afterthought:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would Wednesday evening do for the ceremony?
Not that it makes any difference. I feel as if we had
been married from the beginning of time. I told the
baby about it, and she pleaded for Wednesday. Some
lucky omen, I believe. She said there was no use taking
chances. I wish I had her philosophy of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had <i>her</i>,&#8221; Judith cried, foolish tears rushing
to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you have all of us&mdash;from my father down. I
never saw a conquest more complete.&#8221; The man&#8217;s eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
were moist and shining. &#8220;But, dear, the baby said another
thing. She wants you to let Eileen serve as maid
of honour. Another omen&mdash;that she heard when
Oliver&#8217;s sister came from Brookline to attend Sylvia.
It presages a happy marriage for the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know another old superstition that might apply&mdash;in
a sinister way. My grandmother was full of them.
To serve as a bride&#8217;s attendant, or as godmother at a
christening, she held, was fatal to the little&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice broke and a wave of crimson tumbled over
the fair cheek. A shrug of swift annoyance. Why
should she be blushing like an unsophisticated school-girl?
Larimore Trench caught his breath, and his heart
ceased its monotonous beating.</p>

<p>&#8220;You adorable being! You vestal-hearted woman!
Don&#8217;t let me touch you. Judith, Judith, I shall go mad
with ecstasy.&#8221; He retreated a step, and all at once he
laughed, a laugh of sardonic triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old fool gods! They thought they were destroying
man when they cleft him in two. Olympus
never realized a thrill like this. Send me to the office,
sweetheart. I have to finish the specifications for Miss
Sanderson&#8217;s studio. How can a man build little tawdry
boxes of wood and stone, when his eyes have looked into
heaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith Ascott was sobbing on his shoulder.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>When he had gone, she did an unaccountable thing.
She sent a telegram to her father. It was simple and
direct. She would be married on Wednesday. It would
please her if he could be with her. There would be a
train through Littlefield at four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
and she would have Dutton meet him with the car. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
could return, via Detroit, at eleven the same night.
When the message had gone, she fell to wondering what
motive had actuated her. She and her father were, as
Griff Ramsay had said, strangers. Lary&#8217;s mother? The
thought angered her. Yes, she had had recourse to her
father ... the only available shield against the small-town
criticism that would be reiterated, in veiled innuendo,
the rest of her life. It was her father who had
pursued her&mdash;brought her back to the path of rectitude.
Such a father would lend reasonable sanctity to her second
marriage! Was she, too, in the thrall of that woman,
the slave of that cunning, provincial mind?</p>

<p>She sought for relief in the meeting between Lary and
her father. Would he see in her beloved nothing more
than a village architect? Would her mother be furious&mdash;her
mother who had approved Raoul?</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock the reply came. Mr. Denslow was
starting Tuesday for the southwest, where he was to look
over some oil properties. He would stop off in Springdale,
providing he could get a late train to St. Louis.
His explicit telegram made no mention of the occasion
for his brief visit in his daughter&#8217;s home.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>The train schedule was propitious. He came. The
instant after he had deposited his travelling bag on the
floor of the guest room, he began to ply Judith with
questions concerning the deucedly clever fellow who was
building Avis Sanderson&#8217;s house. He had driven over
the place with some friends, had inspected the drawings,
and had commissioned Ramsay to enter into negotiations
with the architect. By-the-way, he had sold the house at
Pelham. He was thinking of a princely estate on Long
Island&mdash;French château style&mdash;to be finished before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
mother&#8217;s return from Paris. This man, Trench, would
be the one to handle it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, you don&#8217;t seem to understand that I am going
to marry Larimore Trench this evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite so, quite so. Ramsay told me he would
be the one. It&#8217;s a singular piece of good fortune. I
never liked the idea of putting Ben in one of those big
offices, where a young draughtsman is swallowed up.
The boy hasn&#8217;t brains enough to go it alone. This way,
Trench can take him into a partnership. I&#8217;ll talk it over
with his mother. I&#8217;m crossing, the first of December,
for a couple of months in London and on the Continent.
I&#8217;m worn out, and the doctors say&mdash;Damn it all, Judith,
I can&#8217;t give up ... go to the wall at fifty four, with a
family to support. Black specks floating in the air, no
appetite for breakfast. It&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s life, and they&#8217;ll skin
me out of my eye teeth while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221; He stopped,
disconsolate. After a moment he resumed, his manner
somewhat detached:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking that you might have the apartment.
I&#8217;m not in it once a week. Hotel so much more convenient.
Maids sleep their heads off&mdash;nothing to do. I
sold off everything, at Pelham, except the rugs and a few
pictures that the beggars wouldn&#8217;t give me a price for.
Thought I didn&#8217;t know what Orientals were worth. Offered
me thirty dollars for that little Blakelock. An
idiotic smear of red and yellow paint; but it&#8217;ll be worth
money some day, mark my word. And that reminds me ...
Jack has got over his craze for flying machines
and wants to study art. The boy&#8217;s a failure&mdash;no good
on earth. Perhaps Trench will steady him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Larimore, his name is, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Larimore? Ramsay said the name was Trench.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith gave it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>At dusk the simple ceremony was read, Dr. Clarkson
of the College officiating. Sydney Schubert played the
Bridal Chorus from Lohengrin as Mr. Denslow descended
the stairs with his daughter. Before them Eileen
walked, her head bowed, her face pale and serious. In
the cozy angle of the hall, Lary and Dr. Schubert met
them. The formality was a concession to Theodora.
The murmured responses were all but extinguished by
Mrs. Trench&#8217;s sudden flood of weeping. When it was
over, Eileen said to Judith, between lips that hissed with
anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could have choked her. She just did that for effect.
Mrs. Henderson cried when her daughter was married,
and mamma thinks it&#8217;s the proper thing. She nearly disrupted
Sylvia&#8217;s wedding&mdash;and every one in church knew
she was pleased as Punch to get Sylvia off her hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trench led the way to the dining-room, where the
bridal party was served by Nanny and Drusilla, with
Mrs. Dutton in the kitchen. In the domestic realm of
the two households the colour line had never been drawn.
Nanny hailed from that section of New England where
a dark skin excites the same kind of interest that a green
rose or a two-headed calf would elicit. Mrs. Dutton,
Judith perceived early in the days of her tenancy, found
a malicious pleasure in her own function as a social link
between Mrs. David Trench and her negro cook&mdash;a link
that Mrs. Trench saw fit to ignore, since the breaking
of it had thus far baffled even her resourcefulness.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, while Syd and Eileen played
poignant melodies, with David leaning over the piano,
and Lavinia told Dr. Clarkson of the great Denslow
wealth&mdash;her daughter-in-law&#8217;s exalted social position&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Denslow and Dr. Schubert talked of old times in
Rochester, where the youthful physician had had his first
hospital experience, where Denslow, a poor boy with an
iron will, had found the open path to fortune through a
painful accident and a sojourn in a hospital ward. They
drifted to the laboratory experiments, which Judith&#8217;s
father had never taken the trouble to inquire about.
This was just another of the girl&#8217;s wild goose chases. He
wondered why he had such a damnably unsatisfactory
family.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall miss her, cruelly. You don&#8217;t know what it
has meant to my boy and me&mdash;having a woman in the
house four mornings a week. I wanted to train Eileen
to help me with the experiments; but your daughter tells
me they are taking the child with them, to study under a
famous violinist. I have salvaged only one thing out
of the wreck of our two households. They are leaving
Nanny with me. I have worried with six housekeepers
since my faithful Sophie died, two years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The disposition of Nanny was Lavinia&#8217;s bright inspiration.
Obviously Nanny must not go to New York&mdash;to
return a year later and spread gossip.</p>

<p>When Dutton had taken Mr. Denslow to the station,
the wedding guests went home. At the door, Theodora
paused and looked ruefully back. They had ignored her
completely, and was not she responsible for it all? Even
Lary&#8217;s kiss had been abstracted. But then, Lary did
not know. None of the others knew why there was a
wedding at Vine Cottage, that evening. Only she and
Judith understood&mdash;and one of them must have forgotten,
now that the fairy tale had come true.</p>

<p>She looked at the Beloved, standing there in the light
of the little apricot lamp, and her throat swelled with
loneliness and misery. She was not jealous&mdash;even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
they were taking Eileen for a year in New York. Some
one had to stay and take care of daddy&mdash;and she could
do that much better than Eileen, or even Lary. Another
thought came to her, just as Judith perceived her and
held out her enticing arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you still think it was dishonourable&mdash;showing
you the poem Lary wrote?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, darling. It was a stroke of genius. You have
the head of a diplomat. I want you to do something
really truly dishonourable for your sister Judith. After
we have gone, I want you to rummage through Lary&#8217;s
things until you find those two sheets of paper&mdash;the original
ones. Pry open the lid of his desk, if there is no
other way, and send them to me. I am going to have
them framed!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXVI &nbsp; The Light Within</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>A little while before the expressman called for the
trunks, Judith went for the last time through the wicket
gate. She and Eileen had been packing all day, and she
was weary to the verge of collapse. Theodora had hovered
over her ever since she came from school, up in the
attic where winter garments must be looked over, down
in the pantry and cellar, where the Duttons were receiving
orders for the temporary closing of Vine Cottage.
Through it all she had been silent and unobtrusive, her
face wearing an expression that well-nigh broke the heart
of the woman who loved her. Only once did she offer
speech:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s better for my mamma to get natural again&mdash;because&mdash;the
other way she couldn&#8217;t have lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>The remedy that would work such magic once ought
to be efficacious again. Lavinia&#8217;s altered attitude towards
her husband was, beyond peradventure, the result
of her visit in Bromfield. When Judith found opportunity,
she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you will be coming to New York this
fall? There will always be a guest room for you and
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David can&#8217;t get away before spring, with the Marksley
contract crowding him to the wall, and Larimore gone
all the time. If he had any system about him, he
wouldn&#8217;t let things crowd him that way. If I was a
contractor&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;Then, perhaps you will come alone, and stop off at
Bromfield on the way home. Your visit there in July
certainly gave you great benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much benefit&mdash;no one will ever know!&#8221; The
black eyes snapped. &#8220;It almost paid for all that has
happened since. To see some one that you thought was
rich and prosperous&mdash;and find out that they have actually
less than you have&mdash;&#8221; She stopped, and the even white
teeth clicked. &#8220;I mean my brother Ted.&#8221; In crimson
confusion she hurried to the window, where she stood
dumbly contemplating the street. When she turned, it
was to abuse Eileen so extravagantly that she became
aware of the blunder she was making.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Ascott, you mustn&#8217;t listen to what I am saying,&#8221;
she floundered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you call me Judith, now that I am no longer
Mrs. Ascott?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trench laughed foolishly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot that you and Larimore were married last
night. I&#8217;ll forget my own name if I have to live in this
nightmare much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you can get it off your mind if you go to
Bromfield for a few weeks. I am sure Dr. Schubert and
Nanny will look after&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never want to see Bromfield again.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Judith put the puzzle aside and went home to dress
for the train. At the station she kissed David and said,
reassuringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t brood over it, father. Eileen will come
through without a blemish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is any one who can save her it is you. We
had to get her away from her mother. Not that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
blame my wife for this. She is the most conscientious
woman I have ever known, the most positive in her convictions
of morality. She has always set a good example
for her children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the engine whistled for the crossing below
Springdale, and there was a hurrying to and fro on the
platform, for the crashing wheels scarcely came to rest in
the little college town. Judith was glad of the interruption.
Were all good men blind? A moment later she
was waving farewell from the rear Pullman, as David
stood beside the track, Theodora&#8217;s hand clasped in his.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>On Saturday Eileen had her first glimpse of the Hudson.
That evening the Ramsays called, and then ...
Aladdin&#8217;s lamp was relegated to the attic along with the
other wonders that had survived their day of glory.
New York was the real fairy land. From the hippopotamus
in the Bronx to the hippocampus in Battery
Park, the girl saw it all. Sometimes with Judith, more
often with Laura Ramsay or her mother, she went from
elevated to subway, from the amusing little cross-town
horse-cars that were more primitive even than Springdale,
to the thrilling taxicab and the Fifth Avenue bus,
with a zest that whetted the jaded appetites of the women
for whom the city had long since lost its novelty.</p>

<p>After two weeks she decided that she had taken in all
the impressions she could hold, and settled down to her
music in earnest. There were daily letters from her
father, empty because of that fullness he dared not express.
Twice a week Theodora wrote&mdash;exhaustive discourses
on the city, which her imagination rendered more
real than reality itself. There were letters, long or
brief, to Lary from Lavinia, with never a mention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Eileen. The girl wrote four times to her mother, and
then her spirit revolted.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can go to grass before I&#8217;ll ever know she&#8217;s on
earth. I suppose she&#8217;s afraid of contaminating herself.
I&#8217;d like to tell her there are some thinking people&mdash;people
whose opinions count&mdash;who don&#8217;t consider it half
as immoral to go to the devil with the man you believe
you love&mdash;as it is to bear six children for the man you
know you hate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, don&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Judith pleaded. &#8220;You must
not stir up all that rancour in your soul. Remember what
you are stamping on the mind and character of the child
I am going to call my own. You owe it to me&mdash;not to
make my burden too hard. And, Eileen, your mother
is no more responsible for her limitations than you are
for yours. She was brought up to a belief that there
is something supernatural in a marriage certificate.
Morality is wholly a matter of external forms. And she
has the clear advantage of standing with the majority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she always grabs a front seat in the bandwagon.
If it ever gets popular to run off with some other woman&#8217;s
husband&mdash;you&#8217;ll find her in the procession. No!
you won&#8217;t find her. She&#8217;s too set in her ideas for that.
But after the way she cottoned to Mrs. Nims&mdash;when it
suited her purpose&mdash;and other swells in Springdale&mdash;&#8221;
She choked, her face growing scarlet. &#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll never
be intolerant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith sensed the thought that had flared up in the
girl&#8217;s mind, from which she had retrieved herself in a
swift change of subject. Ignoring Mrs. Trench&#8217;s reason
for that first neighbourly call on Adelaide Nims, after
her return from Bromfield, she fell back on the nature of
toleration.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, don&#8217;t you know that you are just as intolerant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of your mother as she is of you&mdash;that you are
like her, when you justify to yourself the thing you want
to do&mdash;and spare your lacerated feelings, when things go
wrong, by finding flaws to pick in some other person&#8217;s
conduct?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eileen hung her head. From infancy she had been
branded as a Trench. And now it shamed her to be told
that she resembled her mother, her mother in whom she
could see nothing but bourgeois complacence. After a
moment she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You always get the nub of it, Judith. How can you
see the inside of things so quick? I can work a thing
out, when once I get a good grip on an idea. I guess
I&#8217;m like mamma there, too. Only&mdash;Lary says you have
to be careful what ideas you give her&mdash;because she&#8217;s like
as not to apply them upside down. I suppose there&#8217;s only
one thing for me to do. I&#8217;ll have to take myself apart
and see what my inner works are like. You shan&#8217;t have
any such vixen as I was, to take care of. I clawed Dr.
Schubert in the eye before I was an hour old. It wasn&#8217;t
an accident, either. I was just naturally vicious. It was
because mamma had put in a whole winter hating me
and papa and the fool Creator who put all the burden of
bearing children on the wife. At least I haven&#8217;t any such
feeling as that. I don&#8217;t even blame&mdash;&#8221; Her cheeks
crimsoned again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame any one but myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were other serious talks, touching the deep hidden
things of life; but as the autumn passed these became
more and more impersonal. Once a week Eileen went to
visit the Ramsays at Rye, usually on Saturday when she
could spend the night, and Laura&#8217;s mother saw to it that
the violin was never left at home. In the suburban
town, young Mrs. Winthrop was an immediate social
success.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXVII &nbsp; David&#8217;s Children</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>November was half gone when Judith wrote to David,
the letter she had yearned to write, weeks ago:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;We are on the eve of victory, the great spiritual victory that
I know means more than anything else to you. Eileen puts in
four hours a day practicing. This evening she is giving a recital
at the church Mrs. Ramsay&#8217;s mother attends. She is a great favourite
in Rye, where the story of her tragic widowhood first stimulated
interest. I know, father, how distasteful this kind of subterfuge
is to you; but Lary agrees with me that it is necessary. As
yet no one suspects. But we must plan a long way ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it all arranged, even to the wording of the announcement
cards I hope to send out, some time next July. But I shall
not dare to show myself in Springdale for another year. There
are too many experienced mothers, who would know whether a
baby was three weeks or three months old. I could not conceal
the telltale marks. I don&#8217;t know what a baby ought to look like!</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything about this to Lary&#8217;s mother. She would
only worry, and she might do something, inadvertently, to spoil
all our planning. Lary would like to have us accompany him
when he makes his next business trip to Springdale. It is perfectly
safe, as far as Eileen is concerned, I assure you. I do so want
you to hear her play. It is not merely technique. I can fairly
hear her soul grow. She is having her growing pains, but they
are good for her. She never speaks of the ordeal that is before
her, and for a week I thought she had forgotten it. When she
brought me an exquisite little garment she had made, every stitch
by hand, I knew I was mistaken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor Auersbach sees a great career for her. The strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in her nature that will militate against high artistic success, such
as he hopes for, is her salvation now. She rebounds from disagreeable
things with the resiliency of a rubber ball. Lary doesn&#8217;t
want her to be famous. He only wants her to grow into a good
woman. It would make you happy to see the little intimacy that
is growing up between them. She doesn&#8217;t at all see in him the
demigod he is to me; but I had the advantage of seeing him first
through Theodora&#8217;s eyes. Tell her how I miss her, and give her
a big hug from her Sister Judith.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>David put the letter away in the safe, with his few
priceless possessions. He wanted to see his children&mdash;the
two whose likeness to him had been a cause for half
humorous apology or bitter reproach. He walked home
from the office, lost in a flood of incoherent longing. If
only Lavinia had never been kind! There was to be a
concert in the college chapel on Thanksgiving evening.
Perhaps Eileen could play in public. His soul revolted
at such philandering with the truth; but he had taught
himself to make peace with the powers that were stronger
than his will or his ability. He quickened his step.
He would offer the suggestion to Vine.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the thing. I&#8217;ll go right over and tell Mrs.
Henderson about it! The women of Springdale will remember
the date&mdash;if anything should ever leak out.
Eileen is built like the Trenches. I remember, your sister
Edith was at church the Sunday before little Buddie
was born&mdash;and when he came, it was a complete surprise.
Nobody suspected anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>David covered his face with his hands. His wife&#8217;s
bald physical view of Eileen&#8217;s soul-tragedy filled him with
loathing. At long intervals, in the years that were gone,
she had forced him to look within the steel-girt casket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
her being, and always he had turned away horrified eyes&mdash;to
restore as best he might the priceless jewels of his
imagining. Could he censure his daughter because she
had believed in Hal Marksley, to her hurt? How had
he judged the one he loved, the woman he had given
Eileen for a mother?</p>

<p>He put the thought aside as wickedly disloyal. Vine
was the mother of his children. She had taken him, a
simple-hearted boy with no ambition beyond the making
of beautiful furniture, and she had made of him a successful
business man. He could no longer make beautiful
things. His fingers had lost their sure touch. But
he had given his children the cultural advantages his
own boyhood had lacked, and he had laid by enough to
care for his family, if he should be taken. He had not
been happy. He knew, all at once, that he had not been
happy. He had never thought of it before. Still, what
right had mortals to demand happiness? Had Vine
been sympathetic, he might never have risen above the
rank of a carpenter. His children would have toiled
with their hands, to measure the stolid level of Bromfield
or Olive Hill. It was Vine, with her far-seeing eyes and
her two-edged tongue, who had made Lary&#8217;s achievement
possible, who had given Sylvia the satisfaction of a marriage
to her liking. It was patent that Sylvia, at least,
was satisfied with her lot.</p>

<p>His eyes turned inward, he began to take stock of his
children. Bob and Isabel were in heaven. The acts
of God were not to be challenged. Lary had periods of
morbid brooding, when life looked worse than worthless.
It would be different, now that he had a wife to love him
... a wife who saw in him a demigod. Such devotion
had stimulated him to greater endeavour than he had
deemed worth while. It might not have worked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
way with Lary&#8217;s father ... if he had had a wife to
soothe and admire him. He might have been too happy
to exert himself. He could not be sure.</p>

<p>The very qualities which had won Judith were fostered
by Vine&#8217;s determination to send Larimore to Cornell.
Just why Cornell, David had no means of knowing.
Lary had not gone to Bromfield for any of his vacations.
So the proximity of the old home town had nothing to
do with it. With all his cultural charm, he might not
have won Mrs. Ascott, had there been no strong incentive
to action. He was inclined to drift, to shun the
crass grip of reality. His happiness had been thrust
upon him, because of Eileen&#8217;s drastic need.</p>

<p>Theodora was too young to be estimated with any degree
of finality. As she was, so had Vine Larimore appeared
to him when, as a boy, he had looked upon her
with yearning eyes. In the after years Vine had been
the prototype of Sylvia. She might have bargained better
with her beauty&mdash;as Sylvia had bargained. What
had prompted Vine to the breaking of that other engagement?
She had told him, times without number, that he
had won her&mdash;against her better judgment&mdash;by his persistent
devotion ... had taken her by storm, and had
thereby driven his rival to a hasty and ill-starred marriage.
How could he have taken any woman by storm?
He felt a little foolish pride in the thought that for one
rash moment he had been bold.</p>

<p>He once heard his wife counselling Sylvia, when she
was on the point of marrying for pique, an elderly
widower in the college faculty. She could afford to
swallow Tom Henderson&#8217;s neglect, Vine had said, if
thereby she might some day step into Mrs. Dr. Henderson&#8217;s
shoes. But Sylvia was in no need of advice. She
would always make the best of her situation&mdash;glamour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it over with a value calculated to inspire envy in the
minds of her friends. It would have been the same, had
she occupied a three-room cottage in Olive Hill, with
miners&#8217; wives for her social equals. She was developing
into a snob. David had not known the meaning of the
word until he felt it in Sylvia, that summer.</p>

<p>He turned for relief to Theodora, the one who was
still plastic. His mind had climbed awkwardly over
Eileen. He must do his work, and a father could not
contemplate that catastrophe and live. Theo understood
him, as none of the others did. She had rejoiced
with him in the seven weeks of his belated honeymoon,
and she sorrowed with him in the bitterness of the aftermath.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>&#8220;What in the world is the matter with you? Have
you gone stone deaf? I have spoken to you three times,
and you haven&#8217;t turned a hair.&#8221; He was aroused from
his musings by Vine&#8217;s raucous voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose my mind was wandering. What do you
want, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you thinking?&#8221; Her eyes were dark
with suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I believe I was thinking about old Selim, the
saddle horse ... you know, Vine, that Dr. Schubert
used to ride when the roads were too muddy for the
buggy. And what sore places the saddle would make on
the poor old fellow&#8217;s back&mdash;and how the sores would turn
into kindly calluses after the saddle had been worn a few
weeks. It was taking the saddle off, and putting it
back on again, that made the new sores. It would be
better never to feel relief from the calloused places than
to have to harden them all over again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>&#8220;Yes! I wish I had never gone to Bromfield. Not
that the trip didn&#8217;t benefit my health wonderfully. But
we wouldn&#8217;t be in all this trouble if I had stayed at home.
And the worst of it isn&#8217;t Eileen, either. I had to give in
to let Larimore marry that grass widow. That&#8217;s the
part that can&#8217;t be so easily undone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vine!&#8221; David Trench towered his full height, his
face stiff with indignation. &#8220;Have you no decency, no
gratitude, no human kindness in your heart? For
shame, to let such words pass your lips!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia laughed, a strangled, empty giggle, while the
red crept up her neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only joking. Larimore says I have no sense
of humour. I think you are the one who can&#8217;t see a
joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see a joke in things that are not to be joked
about. Judith is a noble woman and she has saved you
from disgrace. We are the last people in the world
who have a moral right to bring up her past. We all
make mistakes, even you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made the mistake of my life when I married a man
who always sides against me, no matter what comes up.&#8221;
She began to weep loudly.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>David was wont to coax and comfort until the storm
was over; but this time he put on his hat and
left the house without a word. When he returned at
dinner time the sky was serene and the atmosphere almost
balmy. Lavinia kissed him on both cheeks and
turned to pick a thread from his coat with wifely care.
Her lips wore a satisfied smirk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all fixed. I had the luck to run into a meeting
of the committee at Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s, and they want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Eileen to play three numbers. I have written Judith to
get her the finest dress in New York&mdash;not to mind the
cost&mdash;and to send the titles by return mail. I&#8217;m going to
give a big reception, Friday afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>David smiled wearily. Another whirlpool in his domestic
stream had been navigated, safely. Before him
lay a week of tranquillity. Vine was always amiable,
with some such absorbing task in prospect.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXVIII &nbsp; Indian Summer</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The trio arrived Wednesday morning, with half the
freshman class at the station to meet Eileen. It was all
so different from her going away. How strange the
town looked, how tranquil and confiding the faces of
her friends! What a long, long time she had been gone!
Could she ever again talk to Kitten and Ina as in the old
life? Could she adjust herself, for even a few days, to
the environment that had been her whole world?</p>

<p>The change was not all in herself. There was her
mother&mdash;kissing her ecstatically before all that crowd,
telling her how sweet she looked, how lonely the big house
was without her. And&mdash;did she hear aright?&mdash;declaring
in ringing tones that she should not go back to New York
with Larimore and Judith, but should enter college at the
beginning of the second semester. A moment later Mrs.
Trench passed from this demonstration to embrace Judith
with equal warmth, to address her as &#8220;my dear
daughter&#8221; and lament the shortness of the visit. The
girl was bewildered. Only Theodora was unchanged.
She bubbled and vibrated as of old, pouting disconsolately
when the chapel bell summoned her.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The afternoon was taken up with rehearsal for to-morrow
evening&#8217;s program in the college chapel. Once
Eileen was on the brink of the sordid past. She had
met Adelaide Nims with unruffled composure; but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Kitten joked her about her prospective sister-in-law, and
Ina wanted to know how many evenings a week Hal was
in the habit of spending with her, she almost forgot the
rôle she had been playing ... that in New York she
was Mrs. Winthrop, whereas in Springdale she was still
Eileen Trench, and presumably betrothed to Mrs. Nims&#8217;
brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fool us,&#8221; Miss Henderson teased. &#8220;I bet
Ina a pair of gold-buckled garters that you&#8217;d follow Hal
to New York, instead of going to college here. And
your mother didn&#8217;t get by, this morning, with that line
of talk about keeping you at home. She wouldn&#8217;t tear
you and Hal apart for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eileen felt a sinking in the region of her solar plexus,
but she contrived a flippant retort, and took up her
violin. She had not remembered that Hal Marksley was
in Brooklyn ... that she was likely to meet him in the
subway or at the theatre, any day. In the onrush of her
first disillusionment he had been carried beyond her ken,
as an obstruction of logs and floating débris is torn from
its moorings and scattered in meaningless fragments by
the violence of a spring flood.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Judith, after a few hours with Mrs. Dutton and a
hurried visit from Nanny&mdash;indeed the Doctors Schubert
were dears; but her heart was still with her mistress&mdash;found
Lary in the hall where, less than three months ago,
she promised to love, honour and obey him. He must
make a hurried run to Littlefield, on business for his
father. It was a glorious autumn afternoon and the road
was in fair condition. At his suggestion, Judith took an
extra wrap, for the air would be chill after the sun went
down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>It was the twenty-fourth of November, and the temperature
was that of late spring; but the air held a
dreamy content, as if the earth and her children were
drunk with rare old amber wine. On the brow of a
hill, a little way out from town, Lary stopped the car to
point out a great diadem of irregular rubies, in a setting
of Etruscan gold. That, he explained, was a scattering
of scarlet oaks in a grove composed largely of soft
maples. Here and there a flavescent green asserted
itself, thinly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walnuts,&#8221; he said, his face taking on a boyish look.
&#8220;We had every tree marked, when Bob and Syd and I
were youngsters. You have to pick out the location ...
and remember it. The walnut has no community instinct.
It seldom grows in friendly groups, like the sweet gums
and sugar maples. The leaves are only yellowed by a
frost that turns the oaks crimson over night, and their
formation gives the effect of delicate filigree. Look at
that sumac bush, Judith&mdash;like a great sang de boeuf vase,
with a red on the shoulder that would have filled an ancient
Chinese potter with awe. The flame-red in the
sang de boeuf porcelain was supposed to be derived from
the breath of the gods, while the kiln was at white heat.
This red, that gives a flambé touch to so many of these
sumacs, is an insolent growth of rhus toxicodendron, that
has run wild all over these hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poison ivy,&#8221; Judith cried. &#8220;Yes, we have it in New
York and Connecticut&mdash;all up to the Sound. During
the summer, city people often mistake it for Virginia
creeper, to their sorrow. But after frost, its coral colour
betrays it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something on the grassy slope caught her eye, and
she asked for explanation. Cobwebs. The shrubs were
festooned with them, long streamers floating in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
breeze, like knotted gossamer threads. Over the short
grass they formed a continuous fabric, as delicate as
crêpe chiffon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Millions of spiders set to work with their spinning,
the morning after the first hard frost. No naturalist
has ever explained, to my satisfaction, where they come
from, or what purpose they serve by throwing out all
this maze of webs. I can&#8217;t believe that there is any
utilitarian end in view. As if nature couldn&#8217;t squander a
little effort on pure beauty!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the car had rounded the shoulder of the hill,
Judith touched her husband&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Look, Lary, is that
fire? Not the red of the foliage, but that film of smoke,
away beyond the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed the lead of her gaze, across a dun field
dotted at more or less regular intervals with huge shocks
of withered corn, beside some of which lay piles of yellow
and white ears, husked and ready for the crib. Beyond
this were broad acres of wheat stubble, glistening
silver in the sun. And then the creek, half hidden from
view by a tangle of wild grape and trumpet creeper that
well-nigh suffocated the stunted trees along its bank.
Over the field, the stream, the low woods beyond, was a
silver mist that deepened first to azure, then to smoky
purple, as it met the far horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the result of fire, dear. That is our much
vaunted Indian Summer haze. The Indians had a
legend to explain it. Ask Theo to tell you. It&#8217;s one of
her favourites.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.... I had forgotten. I shall always
associate it with Dr. Schubert&mdash;the peace that came to
him after the long years of tragedy and the final shock
of sudden death. Lary, do you think....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid not, dearest. My mother was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
an off season. Nothing in her case works out on normal
lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they rode on in silence, each wondering how the
other had caught the unvoiced question that was in both
minds.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>The concert, for the benefit of the scholarship fund,
the following evening, was the social event of the season.
Mrs. Trench was disappointed in the dress Judith had
bought for Eileen&mdash;a simple affair of white chiffon, in
long graceful lines, over a satin slip that showed a tracery
of silver threads&mdash;until she heard Mrs. Nims whisper
to Mrs. Henderson that it must have been a late Paris
importation. After that she caught the &#8220;style&#8221; her village
eyes had not perceived. It was worth the price, to
have Mrs. Nims say that to Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>But Eileen&#8217;s appearance, as she emerged upon the
chapel stage from the sheltering screen of palms, was no
disappointment to her mother. As the burst of spontaneous
applause died away&mdash;the violinist bowing recognition,
as graciously as if this were a matter of daily occurrence&mdash;she
heard Kitten exclaim to the girls near her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, isn&#8217;t she stunning! If ten weeks in New York
could do that for Eileen Trench, ten days of it ought to
make a howling beauty of me.&#8221; Then she clapped her
hand to her mouth, remembering Mrs. Trench&#8217;s lynx-ears.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>The visit was one continuous triumphal procession for
the girl. There was her mother&#8217;s reception, Friday
afternoon, at which&mdash;according to the formally engraved
cards of invitation&mdash;the best people of Springdale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
were requested to meet Mrs. Larimore Trench. But
Eileen, behind the coffee urn, was the real attraction.
On Saturday Mrs. Henderson and Mrs. Clarkson joined
in a musical tea, and together they prevailed on the girl
to play Schubert&#8217;s Ave Maria at church, Sunday morning.</p>

<p>When it was ended, and Sunday night saw her safely
on the train, her mother went home to a three days&#8217; sick
headache. If she could &#8220;put that over&#8221; on the smartest
people in Springdale, perhaps there was nothing to fear.
Larimore had some ridiculous story he used to
quote ... about a boy who held a fox under his cloak
while it tore his vitals out. It was a stolen fox, she reminded
herself. After all, it didn&#8217;t matter much what
you did&mdash;so long as you had the grit to keep it under
your cloak.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXIX &nbsp; The Truth that is Clean</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The winter wore away. Larimore Trench was too
deeply occupied to give much time to his small family.
&#8220;Success had come to him unsought: not the success he had
hoped for or desired. Griffith Ramsay opened the way
when, as toast-master at a convention banquet, he introduced
Lary as Consulting Architect&mdash;a title the opulent
New Yorker took seriously. And it was Ramsay who
looked after the contracts, stipulating enormous fees for
the service Lary would have given gratuitously, had he
been left to his own devices.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a robber,&#8221; he told Judith when he handed
her a check in four figures&mdash;compensation for work
that had actually consumed only a few hours of his time.
&#8220;You know, I met the man at a stag dinner, early in December,
and took a real liking to him. He had an option
on a place, and he asked me to go out and look at it.
It was one of the worst atrocities I ever saw&mdash;and I
didn&#8217;t mince words with him. It was such a bargain
that he could afford to spend a little money on drastic
changes&mdash;and I told him what to do. I have often
given that kind of advice to a friend. I wouldn&#8217;t think
of sending in a bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it hurts your pride, to be selling your taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lary looked at her, a light dawning in his limpid
brown eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the most remarkable woman in the world.
You have the insight of a sage ... and the intuition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of a poet. I didn&#8217;t know what was wrong with me.
And in a second you put your finger on the tender spot.
It is precisely the feeling I had the first time an editor
sent me a check for a poem. You don&#8217;t sell things that
come out of your soul. To take money for them is
like rubbing the bloom from the grape. It leaves your
soul shiny and bare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lary, an artist takes money for his pictures.
It is bad for his art if he lives by any other means.
The painter who has no need to work is almost sure
to go stale in a few years. If you had been born when
Greece was at the climax of her glory&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have been an artisan&mdash;taking wages for my
work, like Apollodorus and Praxiteles&mdash;with no more
social opportunity and aspiration than an upper servant,&#8221;
Lary retorted, laughing whimsically. &#8220;The Greeks had
no illusions about art. It was as closely knit with the
kitchen as with the temple. This idea that artists are fit
associates for millionaires&mdash;that is, for the aristocracy&mdash;is
purely a figment of modern times. My repugnance
for money is not the result of my classical training. It
was burned into my mind by the gruelling conflict of
opinions between my father and mother. My father and
I were born to an age that knows only the money
standard. The world&mdash;and my mother&mdash;are not to
blame, if he and I are out of joint with the times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t let it hurt you, Lary ... let it embitter
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sweetheart. I&#8217;ll make a joke of it. I&#8217;ll tell
Ramsay to double his infamous bills.&#8221; And Larimore
Trench went forth to rob another rich man.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Later in the day Laura came to the apartment. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
was a dreary February morning and the outlook from the
front windows was bleak and cheerless. Eileen had sat
for an hour contemplating the waste of sullen water,
and Judith had let her alone. She was thinking things
out. She would come to her sister for help when she
needed it. At times the older woman could follow her
thought process by an intuition that was almost uncanny.
This morning not a glimmer of light came through.
Scarcely had Mrs. Ramsay disposed of her furs and
selected her favourite rocker when the girl began, her
face whiter than usual and her lips compressed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith, I am going to tell her. I can&#8217;t go on feeling
like a dirty sneak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;what, Eileen?&#8221; Laura asked, her hazel eyes
opening in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I, Judith? You know what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you feel that it is right, dear. You know how
it looks to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here goes! Mrs. Ramsay, you and your
husband have been perfectly splendid to me&mdash;and I owe
it to you, not to have you go on this way any longer.
As far as your mother is concerned&mdash;she&#8217;s been a darling;
but I&#8217;ve paid that with my violin. I don&#8217;t need to tell
her. But I do need to tell you that I am not Mrs.
Winthrop, and my husband didn&#8217;t drown in that Alaska
steamship disaster. I am Eileen Trench&mdash;and I never
had a husband....&#8221; She set her teeth hard, then
went on heroically: &#8220;There won&#8217;t be any name for the
baby that comes, the first of May.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen, are you mad! Judith, what has come over
the girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s just cold facts. I&#8217;m not twenty years.
I&#8217;ll be seventeen, the last of March. Long before I was
sixteen I was crazy mad in love with a man. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
mostly my fault&mdash;that he wasn&#8217;t the hero I made him
out, I mean. We were engaged and we talked things
over&mdash;things that aren&#8217;t safe for a girl and a man to
talk about before they are married. I don&#8217;t need to
tell you the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the contemptible cur deserted you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly ... deserted. When we found out, he
said at first that he would be loyal, and would marry me
after he got through with college. To save my reputation,
he wanted me to commit murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to him? How did you answer the
cad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I blacked his eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words fell cold and mirthless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to kill myself, but Judith wouldn&#8217;t let
me. She married Lary, so that they could take&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Laura Ramsay&#8217;s usually placid face took on an expression
of intense emotion. She rose to her feet and walked
hurriedly to the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going to cut me off&mdash;well, that&#8217;s all the
more reason why I had to tell you,&#8221; Eileen said, following
her. &#8220;It&#8217;s what I have to expect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t intend to cut you off, child. Judith, why
couldn&#8217;t I do for her what I did in Nelka&#8217;s case?
Especially if it turns out to be a little girl. Junior is wild
for a sister&mdash;and it&#8217;s the only way I can hope to get one
for him. And of course I&#8217;d be game, if it were another
boy. Won&#8217;t you, Judith? I&#8217;m sure Griff would
approve. Why&mdash;why, Eileen, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl had flung herself on her knees, her face in
Judith&#8217;s lap, her slender body shaken with sobs. When
the paroxysm had passed, she slipped to the floor and sat
looking from one to the other with a wry smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one stumbling block in the way, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Ramsay&mdash;and that&#8217;s <i>me</i>. Judith and I are going to the
sanitarium, the middle of April. After the baby comes,
I am to hand it over to her and forget about it. Why,
I can&#8217;t. I croon over it every night, in my dreams.
When I&#8217;m wide awake, I see him, a splendid man, thrilling
audiences with his violin. Wouldn&#8217;t I lose my head,
some day&mdash;go raving mad and tell the whole thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more reason why it should be in the nursery,
out at Rye, where you wouldn&#8217;t see it. Boy or girl, you
must let me have it. The child will be a musical genius,&#8221;
Laura cried, her eyes beaming with expectant mother-pride.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>That night Judith talked it over with Lary. She had
known, all along, that the thought of this child, with the
Marksley brand, filled him with dread. The following
day Laura came again, with a whole chest of dainty
things. She and her sister had made them before
Junior&#8217;s coming, and he was such a robust baby that they
were outgrown before they had been worn. Griff was as
eager as she.</p>

<p>Gradually, as the weeks passed, Judith divorced herself
from the thought of the child. Had she a right,
when the Ramsays offered sanctuary to the nameless waif&mdash;especially
in view of Eileen&#8217;s preternatural mother-love,
and the great loneliness that had been Lary&#8217;s, before
her coming? There might some day be a child of her
own. Her homesickness for Theodora gave her pause&mdash;and
Theodora had not twined tendrils of helplessness
around her heart. Yes, it was best to let Laura have the
baby....</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXX &nbsp; Katharsis</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>March came, and the layette was practically finished.
Judith Trench looked up from her sewing to realize
with a strange thrill that it was just a year since first she
heard the name of Springdale. She and Lary would
be going to the theatre, that evening. She wondered
whether he had remembered, when he got the tickets.
Eileen was leaving for Rye on an early afternoon train&mdash;indeed
she must be well on the way, going directly from
Professor Auersbach&#8217;s studio. The train must pass
Pelham in a few minutes.</p>

<p>A year ago, Judith Ascott had gone out to Pelham
with the buoyancy of a toy balloon released from its
tether, to break the epoch-making news to her mother.
Now the house at Pelham was in alien hands. Father
was still abroad, was still complaining of floating specks
in the air and a disheartening lack of appetite for breakfast.
Mother was rapturous over the new house Lary
was building for her. Ben was eager to get back to
America, to try his hand at concrete construction. Jack
thought he wanted to be a landscape architect&mdash;with
brother Lary to instruct him. That would beat the
Beaux Arts all hollow.</p>

<p>From one to another of the family, her mind flitted.
Had they not accepted Lary without reservation? Was
not her own life complete? She turned questioning eyes
towards the door. A key in the outer lock. Had Lary
come home early ... remembering? Was he ill?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
The living-room door opened, slowly, as if it were pushing
some imponderable but deadly weight. In an instant she
was on her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen! What has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl sank into the nearest chair and buried her
face from sight. After a moment she said, in a voice
hollow and remote:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use torturing you with suspense. I&#8217;m not
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But something has happened to you&mdash;something
dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith, you don&#8217;t need to go out of your way to hunt
punishment, when you&#8217;ve sinned. And you don&#8217;t need to
dodge it, either. A little while ago I would have thrown
myself in front of a subway train, if I hadn&#8217;t been a
coward. Last summer I thought I had done something
heroic. But when I saw <i>him</i>, this afternoon&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hal Marksley? Eileen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you know the worst.&#8221; She nodded slowly.
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me, Judith, I&#8217;ll tell you from the beginning.
I guess I&#8217;m like mamma in that, too. She has to tell
a thing all in one piece, or she loses the thread of it. In
the first place, I had a great lesson. I was the last,
before luncheon, and Professor Auersbach stopped to
compliment me. It was the first time. He explained
the meaning of <i>hypsos</i>, the sublime reach of spiritual
exaltation&mdash;and he said it had come into my playing
because of what I had suffered. He talked like Syd
Schubert. I went out of the studio walking on air. I
don&#8217;t know what I ate&mdash;or where. All I remember is
that I left too large a tip, because the change came out
wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to the Grand Central and bought a ticket. It
was ever so long before train time, but I thought I&#8217;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
better scout around and see how to get down to the
tracks. You know, the construction people change the
route every few days. The first passage I tried had
been barricaded. I went half way up the stairs when I
came face to face with three men. The one in the middle
was Hal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He recognized you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at first&mdash;and I hurried past them and into a
side aisle. It was a blind pocket, and before I could
get out of it I heard him calling my name. Judith, I
was all alone. Hundreds of people within hearing, and
I was all alone with the man I loathe. It was like a
nightmare&mdash;my feet hobbled with ropes. Before I knew
it, he had me in his arms and was kissing me. I suppose
I fainted. When I began to see things again, we were
in that little temporary waiting-room, and my head was
on his shoulder. I looked at him through a mist ...
and every minute of last summer rolled over me. It
was a flood from a sewer. They say you review your
life when you are about to die. You don&#8217;t need any
hell after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the tumultuous beating of her heart subsided a
little, she went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted to call a taxicab and take me to a hotel.
I didn&#8217;t get his meaning at first. When I did&mdash;life
came back to me. I suppose the people around us
thought we were a married couple, having our first public
quarrel. Once he looked at me with a leer and said:
&#8216;So you were mistaken about what you told me, the
first of September&mdash;or else you took my advice&#8217;. I told
him I was mistaken about a good many things, last
summer. Then he said he had gone to the studio to look
me up, after his sister wrote him that I was studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
music in New York, and the secretary said there was no
one enrolled there by the name of Trench. He chuckled
and said I was a smart kid, and he had half a mind to
take me with him to Rio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He hasn&#8217;t been at Pratt Institute at all. He
flunked his entrance exams. He didn&#8217;t let his people
know, but has been taking all the money they&#8217;d sent him.
Has a position in a Brazilian importing house, and has
been studying Portuguese all winter. They are sending
him down there in an important place&mdash;and he hopes
he&#8217;ll never see this ratty old country again. He even
said he&#8217;d marry me, if ...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there was no return of the old ardour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Judith, only a sick disgust.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>They were still talking when Larimore came home,
surprised and a shade annoyed when he found that Eileen
was there. He had but two tickets, and he wanted to
be alone with his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell him,&#8221; the girl whispered when he left the room
to dress for dinner. &#8220;He is just beginning to respect me a
little. I so want his&mdash;respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>When dinner was over she went to her room. No,
she was not ill. She only wanted to be alone. If Lary
had planned an evening at the theatre, thinking that
she would spend the night at Rye, there was no reason for
a change in his plans. She was glad they were going out,
so that she might be alone. She knew the meaning of
<i>hypsos</i>, now that she had made the descent, within the
brief space of an hour, from that height to <i>bathos</i>,
the lowest depth of sordid physical reality. She wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
play again the winged notes that had carried her beyond
the farthest reach of her own being&mdash;to purge her soul
of the earth-taint that was in her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are perfectly sure you are all right?&#8221; Judith
asked when she told her good-night. &#8220;You won&#8217;t brood
or cry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am past all that. When you strike bottom&mdash;there
isn&#8217;t any farther to go.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>After the play there was a little supper, and then the
long ride in the taxicab. It was nearing two o&#8217;clock when
Judith looked into Eileen&#8217;s room. The bed was empty.
In swift alarm she turned, to catch a faint cry from the
bathroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in here to get some hot water&mdash;and&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t get back,&#8221; the girl groaned, striving to make
light of a desperate situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was heartless of me to leave you alone, at such
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I&#8217;ve had a wonderful evening. I took
my violin ... and we worked it out together. I went
to bed and slept like a rock until&mdash;oh, oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary!&#8221; Judith cried in fright, &#8220;telephone for a
doctor. Eileen is dreadfully ill.&#8221; The tortured girl
had striven to rise, but fell back convulsed on the rug.</p>

<p>When Larimore had carried her to her bed, he said
huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Only this evening, when we were going out, I was
thinking how fortunate it was to have a doctor here in
the apartment. He came up in the elevator with us. He
may not care to take this kind of case, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary, you must be mistaken. It&#8217;s not to be for
almost two months. And if you were right&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
be over by this time? She&#8217;s been suffering two hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first one is often premature. Eileen is a highly
emotional nature. And I suspected at dinner that something
was wrong. As to the duration&mdash;no one can gauge
that. I was with my mother for three hours before
Theodora was born. My father was out of town, and
mamma wouldn&#8217;t have Sylvia around. Bob had been
sent for the nurse, and there was nothing to do but wait.
Dr. Schubert knew my mother&#8217;s habits. He said there
was no hurry.&#8221; They had reached the outer door of the
apartment, his hand on the knob. &#8220;In those three hours,
Judith, I was transformed from a sentimental boy to a
morbid, cynical man. Syd has tried to change my viewpoint;
but all his reasoning is empty. He will never be
called upon to bear children.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later he returned with the physician,
in bathrobe and slippers. It was almost morning
before a nurse arrived; but one of the maids was herself
a mother, and intelligent help was not wanting. After an
hour Lary led his wife from the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetheart, you can&#8217;t help her, and you are enduring
every pang she suffers. Her pain is mostly physical now.
Yours is both physical and mental. You must not
squander your strength. We will need it for the harder
part to come. Won&#8217;t you lie down and try to sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep! when the most terribly significant thing in the
world is under way? How can we grow so callous? I
never realized the marvel of life until now. I must go
through every heart-throb of it. I need it! I will have
more pity for your mother, more toleration for my own
mother, more love for you, Lary&mdash;if there is any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Larimore Trench closed his eyes, bitter self-abasement
surging through his being. He had never been at grips
with life. Nay, rather, he had turned from it in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
superior attitude of disdain. He would not touch the
woman he loved. She was too holy for his coward&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>As the grey dawn was breaking over the snow-whitened
Hudson, the nurse aroused the two who dozed in their
chairs in the living-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come,&#8221; she said excitedly. &#8220;Mrs.
Winthrop isn&#8217;t going to hold out.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the door the physician waved them back. Judith
caught a glimpse of Eileen&#8217;s deathlike face and she ran
sobbing down the hall. A long time she stood, her
husband&#8217;s cherishing arms around her. Then a petulant
wail from the room at the end of the long hall told them
it was over.</p>

<p>At noon a letter to David was posted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;You must be prepared for the worst. Early this morning a
little girl came. It weighs less than four pounds. The doctor
says, considering its premature condition, the extreme youth of
the mother, and the circumstances of delivery, there is not one
chance in ten that it will survive. We are more concerned for
the mother. I will telegraph you, only in case of extremity.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Laura Ramsay had come, in response to a long-distance
call, and she and Judith stood beside the nurse when,
after twelve hours of earth-life, the unformed morsel of
humanity gave up the struggle.</p>

<p>It was not until the following morning that they told
Eileen her baby had died. Lary was with them. He
had looked for a passionate outburst. He could not
fathom her mood as she lay, quite tranquil, on her
pillow, a smile gathering radiance in her deepset eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way,&#8221; she said at length. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
it won&#8217;t have to face life&mdash;with such a handicap.
It&#8217;s better for all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lary stooped and kissed her. He wondered why
women were so much stronger than men, why, in most of
life&#8217;s crises, they must bear the shock.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Eileen&#8217;s strength returned slowly. It was the middle
of April before she ventured out to Rye, a pallid wraith
of her former self. Griff and Laura were afraid for her
... a fear that was transformed into action by the
potent chemistry of a woman&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Round up a bunch of Lary&#8217;s patrons,&#8221; Mrs. Ramsay
said in her decisive way, &#8220;and convince them that they
ought to send him abroad to buy furnishings for their
new homes. He and Judith can take Eileen along. The
sea voyage will&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital!&#8221; Griff cut in. &#8220;Only yesterday I had Parkinson
on my neck for an hour, howling about the difficulty of
getting draperies and rugs for the stunning place Lary
has made of his old junk heap. Commissioned a fellow
in Paris to send him some things and&mdash;Lord love us!
You should have seen the consignment! It wasn&#8217;t the
price. But Parkinson hates to be laughed at, when he&#8217;s
been stung.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary&#8217;s orderly mind would take care of the needs of a
dozen men like Parkinson, and it would give him a chance
to see Europe&mdash;right!&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thus it came about that on a serene May morning
Judith Trench dismissed the maids, closed the apartment
and set her face towards the rising sun. For her it was
the real adventure. She had looked at Europe so often.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Now she would see through the shell, with Lary&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>At the Cherbourg pier Mr. Denslow met them.
Mamma and the boys could hardly wait to see Judith&#8217;s
new husband. But after a week Lary&#8217;s importance was
blurred, sent into almost complete occultation, as Eileen&#8217;s
vivid youth asserted itself. Ben was her slave from the
first. The night after they left her in Brussels, to have
a few lessons with Ysaye, and Lary and Judith set forth
on their real honeymoon, he confided to his mother that
he was going to add another Trench to the Denslow
family, as soon as he was sure he could earn a living for
two.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you asked her?&#8221; Mrs. Denslow quizzed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She thinks I&#8217;m a boy. You might tell her that I&#8217;m
nearly five years older than she. I thought I&#8217;d grow
whiskers&mdash;to impress her.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>From Antwerp to Munich, from Venice to Constantinople,
and thence by boat to Naples and the eastern coast of
Spain, Lary and the other half of his being wandered,
too happy to remember the fiery ordeal wherein their
severed selves had been fused again. When they
reached Paris, the middle of August, a great pile of letters
awaited them. Lary thrust one of them into his inside
pocket. It was from his mother. Another he tore open
with eager fingers. A moment later he handed it to
Judith, his eyes shining. It bore the signature of a
discriminating editor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I never knew why Renaissance art, with all its brilliance and
charm, was unsatisfying to me, until I read your keenly analytical
essay. We would be glad to consider a series of essays, covering
other architectural periods and styles.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Denslow read the letter with indifference, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
accompanying check had weight. He was coming to believe
that his daughter had made a first-rate investment
when she went to look after her interests in Olive Hill,
and incidentally acquired a husband who could make
good in New York in six months.</p>

<p>Judith followed Lary to his room, whither he had retreated
to read the letters from home. One glance at
his face satisfied her that all was not well. A moment
he wavered, on the point of thrusting that disturbing letter
out of sight. Then he recognized, in his feeling, not
loyalty to his mother but a raw personal chagrin. Judith
was his wife. She had earned the right to share even his
humiliation. Yet he dared not look at her while she
read the closely written pages.</p>

<p>His father was breaking. It was his duty to come
home and assume the burden, now that the reason for his
absence from Springdale, with Judith and Eileen, had
been removed by an unhoped-for act of Providence.
The building of a great place like the Marksley home
was too much for David, who never could shoulder responsibility.
She had tried to fire his ambition&mdash;make
him see how proud he ought to be, to get a chance to put
up such fine buildings. It was wasted breath. He went
about as if he had a sack of concrete on his shoulders.
He would certainly have to forfeit money on the contract.
She was outdone with him, and must have help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, cable your father to throw over that contract,
no matter what it costs. Can&#8217;t she see that his soul is being
ground&mdash;because of you and Eileen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t send such a cablegram, dear. I didn&#8217;t want
ever to see Springdale again. You and Eileen can stay
on here with your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Lary, I shouldn&#8217;t mind Springdale. David and
Theo are there&mdash;and an arbour with a summer house&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Indian Summer coming. It would be worth all the
rest ... a cheap price to pay, for another such afternoon
as we had last November, on the road to Littlefield.
Is it always as glorious as that, Lary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Usually, but not always. I remember, once when I
was a young boy, there was no frost at all until the first
week of December. The glorious tints and that silver
haze in the air are the result of a heavy frost that catches
the foliage in full sap. But that year&mdash;it was the winter
Theo was born&mdash;the trees were a sickly gray-green, and
all the shrubs and vines looked as if they were suffering
from some wasting disease. The leaves had shrivelled,
and still they clung. The morning after the frost they
fell like rain. Within three days the branches were stark
and bare. It was absolutely startling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had no crimson and gold, no chiffon webs on the
grass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that year. It was an open winter, with a frost
late in the spring, that killed all the fruit. Don&#8217;t set your
heart on&mdash;I mean, dear, don&#8217;t go back to Springdale ...
just for the Indian Summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going, Lary, to comfort your father.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>That evening they told Mrs. Denslow that they would
book passage for an early return to New York. And
that lady, whose plans had been changed so often within
the past year, was glad to have her shifting course in life
directed by some one with a real necessity. They would
all go home together, especially as Ben was eager to get
to work. Not at his instance, but rather because the girl
promised relief from the boredom that had begun to
weigh heavy on her, Mrs. Denslow urged Eileen to spend
the winter in New York.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8220;Papa&#8217;s health is failing. He needs me,&#8221; was the eminently
satisfactory reply. To Judith the girl confided
another reason. The apartment overlooking the Hudson
held memories she did not wish to revive. She was
done with that chapter of her story. She had climbed,
with bleeding feet, to a hilltop ... and the future lay
misty with promise before her.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was like the home-coming of a national hero. The
college paper and the little local daily had announced that
Miss Eileen Trench had played at a private audience with
the King of Belgium&mdash;the paragraph inspired by her
mother, when one of the letters from Brussels brought
the humorous announcement that His Majesty had
stopped his motor car in front of her window while she
was practicing a brilliant Chopin number.</p>

<p>Judith thought the crowd was at the station as a tribute
to Lary&#8217;s recent triumphs. And Lary thought, bitterly,
that his New York success had won him the plaudits
of his native town. Theodora told them both the
truth, on the way home. She was afraid too much adulation
would turn Eileen&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>At first they did not miss David in the throng. A year
ago he and Theodora had stood alone on the little station
platform. Judith knew why he was not there now.
Eileen knew, too, and her eyes darkened with suffering.
He was at the gate as they approached. Lary caught his
breath sharply, as he took in the shrunken figure and the
mournful eyes. Eileen leaped from the cab and ran to
greet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her as one awakening from deep sleep.
Then all at once the smile broke ... it spread, like
ripples on the surface of a placid pool. Every emotion
of his heart was recorded on that transparent face. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
blue eyes beamed with incredible joy, as he held out his
arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my little girl. I thought I had lost you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, daddy dear, it&#8217;s only that I have found myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia hurried into the house. She could not bear
such spectacles in public. What would the neighbours
think?</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The following day an astounding thing came to pass.
The president of the college and the dean of the musical
faculty called on Miss Trench. They wanted to offer
her a position in the conservatory. Naturally it could
not be an actual professorship. A seventeen-year-old
girl ... without a degree. They thought she might
give recitals in the neighbouring towns, and take pupils
in advanced technique. It would mean much to the college
to announce an instructor who had studied with the
great Ysaye. No one need know how young she was.
Indeed she was altogether different from the immature
girl they remembered&mdash;quite dignified and impressive.
Marvellously changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they knew what changed her,&#8221; Mrs. Trench reflected,
her gorge rising, &#8220;they wouldn&#8217;t be flattering her
this way.&#8221; It was a mistake to tell that about the King
of Belgium. She hadn&#8217;t thought about the effect on
Eileen. Of late she blundered at every turn. Somehow
things were slipping out of her grasp.</p>

<p>After they had gone, Eileen ran breathless to Vine
Cottage to tell Judith. She could not contemplate any
step without that guidance or approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary will be pleased. This will put an end to your
mother&#8217;s plan of having you enter the freshman class next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Monday. But ... Eileen, I have an idea. You are
not going to stop studying. I wonder if you and I
couldn&#8217;t&mdash;I&#8217;m a horribly uneducated person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Lary for tutor, you mean? Well, in the first
place, my brother&#8217;s no salesman when it comes to the
things he knows. He can lay them out on the counter
and let you pick what you want. What I want most is
Latin. And he thinks it is bald and plebeian, compared
with Greek. Syd reads Horace, in the original, to rest
him when he&#8217;s tired and can&#8217;t get his mind off of the sick
babies and their fool mothers. I&#8217;m crazy to translate
Ovid and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd&#8217;s just the thing. Don&#8217;t tell Lary, but I foundered
on the Greek alphabet. It simply wouldn&#8217;t stick in
my memory. I substituted organic chemistry. My classicist
husband would be disgusted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lary&#8217;s a prig&mdash;and I love him! Judith, it was worth
it&mdash;just to get acquainted with my brother.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>From Vine Cottage she went to the office for David&#8217;s
stamp of approval. She had once called her father a
rubber stamp. She thought of it now, with stinging chagrin.
Would not he serve as her anchor, as Judith had
been her pilot? Had she anything to fear? As she
walked past the clump of shrubbery on the campus, where
Hal Marksley had kissed her that first time, she thought
with a thrill of exultation that her craft had outrun the
storm.</p>

<p>From her father&#8217;s arms she hurried to Dr. Schubert&#8217;s
office to tell the joyful and as yet half apprehended news.
And the man who had heard her first shrill cry of protest
against the life that was not of her choosing, drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to him and kissed her. The act was paternal. She had
always been more at home with him than with those of
her own blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Syd,&#8221; she beamed, &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t know what
he&#8217;s in for.&#8221; And Sydney, coming through the laboratory
door with a microscope slide in one hand and a bottle of
red colouring fluid in the other, put up his mouth for the
customary salutation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more of that, old fellow. I&#8217;m a young lady now.
Besides you&#8217;re going to be my preceptor, and it&#8217;s bad
form for the dominie to kiss his pupils. You&#8217;re to teach
Judith and me, and you couldn&#8217;t bestow osculations on
one and not on the other. Now could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think Judith would be lovely to kiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is ... but you and Lary can&#8217;t go out in the alley
and fight duels. And while we are on the subject&mdash;you
and Papa Schubert are ages behind the times&mdash;with all
your X-rays and bacteriological tests. In Europe they
have decided that kissing is unsanitary. Disease germs
are carried that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the elder assented, &#8220;the dangerous little amorococcus
is usually conveyed from lip to lip.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syd changed the subject. He had never been seriously
touched by love. But he thought the shaft of his father&#8217;s
playful humour might carry a poisoned barb for the girl.
He demanded, with a grimace:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take me into your confidence about the
preceptorship? What do you need to learn ... after
Brussels and Paris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had thought about Latin&mdash;and anything else you
happen to have in your system that would help us to shine
as intellectuals. But, seriously, Syd, I want you to do
one thing for me. Get this <i>teaching</i> idea across to me.
You remember how you gave me the legato&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Prexie Irwin was making us whack the strings with the
bow&mdash;everything jumpy staccato, don&#8217;t you remember?
And how you showed me, in five minutes, how to produce
the singing tones? I know how to do it; but you&#8217;ll have
to show me how to teach the other fellow.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>When the door had closed behind her, Dr. Schubert
said jubilantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The child isn&#8217;t spoiled a bit. I&#8217;ve been afraid she&#8217;d
come home sophisticated and world-wise. She&#8217;s just an
innocent girl, in spite of her long skirts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Sydney said, with a catch in his throat, &#8220;she&#8217;s
as pure and fair as a May morning&mdash;and the fairest
mornings are always the ones that follow the darkest
nights. Father, couldn&#8217;t you trump up some excuse to
bring her here to stay with us ... keep her away from
her mother as much as possible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious, Syd, but I was going to speak to you about
that very thing. David came to me, when he knew
Eileen was coming home and asked me&mdash;oh, it was tough
for him to do it. He&#8217;s so damnably loyal! Don&#8217;t you
think we could fit up the room next to Nanny&#8217;s, so that
the child could sleep here, the nights when she&#8217;s going to
have early classes at the college? It&#8217;s a shame to deprive
David of even that much of her company. But
we&#8217;ll make it up to him in ways his wife doesn&#8217;t suspect&mdash;if
we can inject enough guile into him to enable him to
play his part without fumbling. He feels that she must,
<i>must</i> be kept away from her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the trouble with David?&#8221; Syd asked abruptly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve doped him on tonics all summer, and he doesn&#8217;t
improve in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The climacteric&mdash;and his wife&#8217;s merciless tongue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
David is approaching fifty. A man&#8217;s mental and physical
being undergoes a subtle change in that year. It&#8217;s
not so crucial as the grand climacteric&mdash;the transformation
from manhood to age&mdash;that comes at sixty-three.
You young doctors will be telling us that it is an exploded
theory; but I have followed it for forty years. To a
sensitive chap like David Trench, it&#8217;s serious. Just this
year, when he ought to be coddled and petted, his wife
seasons his food with gall and puts a dash of aqua fortis
in his tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ordered him to sleep in a room by himself, with
the door locked, so that she couldn&#8217;t wake him up with
her nagging and upbraiding. I told her, point-blank,
that she was killing him&mdash;and she did what I might have
expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she &#8216;slipped from under&#8217; by writing Lary that
she was being terribly set upon by his father, and it was
his duty to come home. Father&#8221;&mdash;Syd&#8217;s blue eyes
blazed&mdash;&#8220;why didn&#8217;t David take a riding whip to his wife
the first time she&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who could look beneath sex interrupted with
an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;David is a woman. More than that, Sydney, Mrs.
Trench is a man&mdash;trapped in a woman&#8217;s body. When
nature makes a blunder like that, there&#8217;s usually the devil
to pay. I have to keep reminding myself of that fact&mdash;or
I&#8217;d be in danger of poisoning Lavinia Trench.&#8221;</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Autumn was on the threshold of winter when Lavinia
decided that things had to take a turn. Eileen was
spending three mornings a week at the college, which necessitated
her absence from home practically half the
time. She was uniformly polite and gentle with her
mother, an attitude that was not wholly the result of
Judith&#8217;s stern schooling. Under the whip of her own
discipline, she sought to round off the rough corners, to
modulate her voice and temper her diction. Her outbursts
of picturesque speech were reserved for Dr. Schubert
and Syd, with Nanny in the background, shaking her
ample sides with adoring laughter. Now there would be
a fortnightly concert trip, and some elective work in the
academic department, which promised further separation
from the chilly atmosphere of her home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith, I want to have a talk with you,&#8221; Mrs. Trench
began, and the stern set of her jaw left no doubt that the
interview would be unpleasant. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way
Eileen is acting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one else does.&#8221; Judith sought to be impersonal.
She had been expecting some such outburst and
had framed a line of defence, against a possible attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it! Everybody in Springdale thinks she
has done something fine in going away to New York and
Europe, and coming back here to teach in the college before
she&#8217;s even been a student. You are making a rank
hypocrite of her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>&#8220;I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&mdash;who else but you? You did the whole
thing. I am sure Larimore is as disgusted as I am; but
he doesn&#8217;t dare to say&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t discuss my relations with my husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia&#8217;s face flamed scarlet and she tugged at the
collar of her elaborate silk waist. But speech was not
wanting, for more than the fraction of a second.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I want to know what other wild-goose schemes
you have for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith shifted impatiently in her chair. &#8220;You have a
grievance. I wish you would be specific. Eileen is
surely not causing you any anxiety. She is growing into
a beautiful young woman and she has the respect of the
entire community.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Respect! Yes!&#8221; The words crackled. &#8220;The whole
town respects her. You can&#8217;t see what that means.
You have no religion and no moral sense of your own.
For a girl to do what she did&mdash;and then walk right back
here into a position that she never would have had, if
she&#8217;d been a good girl, is a positive slur on religion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith gasped. She wanted to laugh&mdash;to take her
mother-in-law by the shoulders and shake her. But
Lavinia had not done speaking:</p>

<p>&#8220;It says in the Bible&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It says a good many things in the Bible. You take
from it what appeals to you&mdash;and shape your religion to
suit your own needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia was not slow to catch an idea that could be
stopped by the mesh of her mental net. Her son&#8217;s philosophy
usually passed through without leaving a fragment.
But this idea was large enough to be arrested.
Two facts conspired to give it substance and form. For
his Sunday sermon, the minister had combined a passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from Isaiah with another from the Epistle to the Hebrews.
And&mdash;wholly unrelated, but subtly significant&mdash;Lavinia
had just finished an elaborate gelatine dessert
for dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that we pick from the Bible what we want
and fit it together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically that. We can&#8217;t get anything out of a
book unless we have in our own minds the vessels to
carry away the meaning. A cult or a religion is nothing
more than the solidifying of a group of ideas. The
Christian religion&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like lemon jelly in a mould,&#8221; the woman said, thinking
aloud. Then, arousing herself to the business at
hand, she pursued: &#8220;That may be all true enough about
religion; but it has nothing to do with Eileen, and the way
she&#8217;s acting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you to be definite. What has she done that
displeased you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Staying at Dr. Schubert&#8217;s, three nights in the week&mdash;with
no woman there except a housekeeper. What will
the neighbours say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard them say anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but they&#8217;re likely to. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d think it was
queer if Ina Stevens&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t suggest it to them. And another thing&mdash;I
wouldn&#8217;t say a word to Eileen&mdash;if I were you. She is
doing so well that it would break Lary&#8217;s heart to have
her thrown back on the old life. There is only one danger,
as he sees it. She has a strong vein of stubbornness
in her nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she gets that from her father,&#8221; Lavinia snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she doesn&#8217;t get it from her father. There is no
obstinacy in father, except his stubborn clinging to his
ideals. You can&#8217;t deal with Eileen as you did with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Sylvia, and you&#8217;ll play havoc with her if you try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Sylvia never caused me a moment&#8217;s anxiety in
her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith ignored the palpable falsehood. &#8220;You must
know that Eileen couldn&#8217;t have finer moral influence than
that of Dr. Schubert and his son. And my faithful
Nanny is no ordinary servant. She was more to me than
my own mother, when I was a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The innocent remark was flint and steel, with Lavinia&#8217;s
powder heap in dangerous proximity. &#8220;I suppose your
mother was <i>delighted</i> with that. But of course she was
a rich woman, and glad to be rid of the moral training of
her children. I can say for myself that I never shirked
my duty&mdash;and I don&#8217;t intend to hand it over to you or
Nanny or Dr. Schubert now. I made up my mind that
I wouldn&#8217;t say a word about this; but it&#8217;s grinding my
heart out. I can&#8217;t stand it any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I don&#8217;t follow you at all. I asked you to
be frank with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll put it so plain that you can&#8217;t pretend
you don&#8217;t understand. How would you feel if you had
a daughter, and some stranger came along and took that
girl&#8217;s life clear out of your hands? I haven&#8217;t a word to
say about her. She runs to you for all sorts of things&mdash;clothes&mdash;as
if I wouldn&#8217;t know what was stylish or becoming.
If she&#8217;s in doubt about what to do, she talks it
over with Larimore or Syd. When anything comes
along to make her proud, she tells her father. She talks
to Theodora by the hour about the things she saw when
she was abroad&mdash;and she never tells me one thing. I&#8217;m
simply shut out on every side, and it&#8217;s killing me!&#8221; She
burst into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, mother. I hadn&#8217;t realized. Perhaps
if you weren&#8217;t always so short and critical with her&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m to go down on my knees to her? Indeed I
won&#8217;t. As long as she is under eighteen, she takes her
orders from me. She&#8217;ll go to the dogs, with all this flattery
and praise&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The surest way to ruin Eileen is to take that attitude
towards her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she is <i>my</i> child, and I have a right to do with
her as I please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;you&mdash;have&mdash;not!&#8221; Judith&#8217;s eyes flashed and
her voice was hoarse with indignation. &#8220;Rather than
permit you to wreck her chance for happiness, I&#8217;ll send
her to Laura Ramsay&mdash;or even to my mother.&#8221;</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Lavinia fled weeping through the door. She would
tell Larimore how his wife had insulted her. Unfortunately
he was in New York. At least she could write to
him ... and the letter had distinct advantages. She
would be spared interruption. Larimore always broke
the point of her lance before she had time to drive it
home. She wrote. She read the long letter through
twice&mdash;and tore it into shreds. A second letter followed
the first one. Then it was time to go down to luncheon.</p>

<p>When the noonday meal was over, and David and
Theo had gone, she went again to Vine Cottage. Judith
was in the library, an open volume of Browning on the
table before her. Her face was pale and her eyes
showed flecks of hazel.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a misunderstanding this morning, my dear,
and I don&#8217;t want to leave things that way.&#8221; The words
came with a brave show of confidence, but Lavinia
Trench looked like a corpse, an automaton that was made
to speak by a force other than its own. &#8220;I am going to
ask you to forgive me, and help me as you did Eileen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, mother!&#8221; The cry was from her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would be surprised. I never apologized
to any one in my life. I&#8217;ve been fighting it for a week.
When I said those things, this morning, it was to keep
from saying what&mdash;what I&#8217;m going to say now. Since
Eileen came home, I&#8217;ve been going over my life. David
said she had missed the path, and you showed her the
right way. I am the most unhappy woman in the world.
If you could do that for Eileen, you could do it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a challenge, flung like a pelting of hail stones.
Judith looked at her with troubled gaze. How could
she deal with a mentality so different from her own?
Eileen was young, and Eileen loved her. That her
mother-in-law cordially detested her, she could not doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I would gladly....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all perfectly simple&mdash;excepting two points. By
all the rules of right and wrong, Eileen ought to be a
miserable girl, broken in soul and body&mdash;and not respected
by good people. It doesn&#8217;t make a particle of
difference that she hid her wickedness. God knows what
she did, and it is God that punishes sin. Instead of that,
she comes back here better in every way than she was before.
She&#8217;s prettier now than Sylvia. She used to be
cross and hateful most of the time. Now she laughs
and sings and whistles till I wish she would pout for a
change. She sits up and discusses the most serious topics
with grown men and women&mdash;and you know how she
used to rattle slang, and sneer at people who were serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her experience developed her marvellously. It
might have wrecked her, just as a powerful dose of medicine
might destroy your body, if administered in the
wrong way. It was fearful medicine, but it was what
her sick mind needed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>&#8220;That takes care of one of the points,&#8221; Lavinia cried,
her black eyes dilating. &#8220;You call it medicine. I saw
it only as the consequences of sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the name does matter. I want to get this thing
down in black and white. All my life I have been discontented.
It&#8217;s just one crushing disappointment after
another. Eileen was the same way. I never used to
think she was like me&mdash;but in some respects she is. I
had a chance to marry the son of the richest man in town.
But I have always been virtuous and upright&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, perhaps if you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt me. I have to say this all at once,
while it&#8217;s connected. You call Eileen&#8217;s discontentment
and rebellious nature a kind of disease. Well then, I
had the same disease, and she got it from me. After my
grandmother died, there wasn&#8217;t one in the family that
understood me. And the man I was engaged to&mdash;&#8221;
She brought her teeth together, as if she were biting
off and forcing back the words that strove to assert themselves
in spite of her. &#8220;I threw him over, when I found
out that he was an unprincipled scoundrel, like Hal
Marksley. If I had gone on, as she did&mdash;but I never
could have done such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not. You were brought up in a provincial
New York town. You were hedged about by customs
and convictions that don&#8217;t obtain in Springdale, or among
Eileen&#8217;s associates. You must make allowance for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia sidestepped the interruption. &#8220;Eileen was
sick&mdash;and God picked out a remedy that I thought God,
in His purity, wouldn&#8217;t know anything about. I was
taught that it was the devil that&mdash;well, I&#8217;ve been figuring
that she had to come to grief, because she went over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Satan. That&#8217;s the only way I could square things with
my religious training. I don&#8217;t believe, now, that she will
ever be punished. That shows that it was God and not
the devil that did it. I&#8217;m willing to admit that I was mistaken,
if you&#8217;ll show me how to find happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a recipe, like the ingredients for a cake. And
you must remember that I didn&#8217;t prescribe the remedy, in
Eileen&#8217;s case. I only nursed her, after she had taken it.
I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea why you are unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I would have to tell you the whole story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t pry into your heart. I would do anything
in my power to give you peace. You are Lary&#8217;s mother.
I have never overlooked my obligation to you.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Lavinia took from the words an implication more humiliating
than her daughter-in-law had intended. But
this was no time for recrimination. She must hold on to
herself. The canker in her heart had eaten so deep
that help must come, or she would go mad. Mechanically
she reached for the volume on the table. Her
mind went back to those first years in Springdale, when
she had conned Browning in an effort to shine in Mrs.
Henderson&#8217;s club. Was it indeed for this that she had
memorized poems, delved in abstruse literary criticism&mdash;that
she might win Mrs. Henderson&#8217;s approbation?
One half of her knew that it was not, while the other
half as stoutly denied an ulterior motive for this, or for
any other deliberate act of her life.</p>

<p>While she was giving the attic its annual overhauling,
she had come upon the yellow files of the Bromfield Sentinel,
the edges broken like pie crust. She had read
again the spirited account of the meeting at which Mrs.
David Trench was elected secretary of the most intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
club in Springdale. Who was there in her girlhood
home for whom this triumph would provide a thrill of
gratification or a sting of envy? Ellen knew all about
it. Isabel had long since removed to California. Her
mother was dead. The girls of her social circle? The
Browning craze had not invaded Bromfield, and there
was not one among her old friends for whose opinion she
cared a straw.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>She came back to herself with a start. &#8220;The Statue
and the Bust,&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;We did that one, the
winter before Isabel was born. I had to drop out&mdash;and
Mrs. Henderson sent me her notes. It was a shockingly
immoral thing, for the wife of a college president&mdash;a
Presbyterian minister, at that. I never had quite the
same opinion of her, after I read those notes. She said
the lady who sat at the window and watched for the duke
to ride by&mdash;would have been less wicked if she had actually
run away with him. She said it was just as bad to
want to commit sin as to actually commit it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if they restrained themselves only because of
fear of the consequences. There is no virtue in that kind
of repression.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Lavinia Trench everything was personal. She
turned the thought over in her mind ... &#8220;afraid of the
consequences&#8221; ... &#8220;no virtue in that kind of repression.&#8221;
Her whole life had been one of repression.
Mrs. Henderson had stressed the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;And the sin I impute to each frustrate ghost</div>
<div class="indent">Is the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin,</div>
<div class="verse">Though the end in sight was a vice, I say.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t my idea of sin. At least it wasn&#8217;t, until....&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
She trailed off into incoherence, thumbing the
pages nervously. &#8220;Judith, do you think a woman&mdash;a
married woman&mdash;could go on caring for some other
man&mdash;&#8221; She struggled with the obstruction in her
throat. &#8220;I mean the bride of Riccardi, in the poem. I
can&#8217;t see how caring, and just thinking how much she
would like to be with him&mdash;was&mdash;wrong. She didn&#8217;t
commit any act of sin&mdash;didn&#8217;t break the seventh commandment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the eyes of the world she was a virtuous woman.
In her own heart she was an unsatisfied wanton. She
added hypocrisy to the sin of desire, and on that hypocrisy
she wrecked her only chance for happiness.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Once before, Judith had attempted to implant an abstract
idea in Mrs. Trench&#8217;s mind. Now she was betrayed
into a discussion of moral responsibility, with no
intent other than that of bridging over a trying period of
her none too comfortable relations with her mother-in-law.
That Lavinia would carry away even a germ of an
idea, she did not suspect. She had merely reiterated
what Mrs. Henderson had said, twenty years ago. As
yet she had not fully perceived, in that warped mind, one
dominating characteristic: the ability to find justification
for anything that seemed desirable. True, Eileen had
said&mdash;but Eileen was not always fair in her old-time
strictures on her mother.</p>

<p>Judith looked at the abject figure, the pallid face and
the hard mouth ... and pity overmastered her. She
wanted to say something comforting. The door was
shut, the discussion ended. Lavinia sat there, pondering.
It was all so different from the groundwork of her
religious training. Probably Browning and Judith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Mrs. Henderson were wrong. To her literal mind, their
idea could not accord with the stern dictum: &#8220;The wages
of sin is death.&#8221; Still, their theory would serve to explain
Eileen. In her pondering, she went the length of
formulating the postulate: &#8220;Eileen sinned and became
happy. Her sin was the source of her regeneration.&#8221;</p>

<p>There must be something to it. She, Vine Larimore,
had been virtuous&mdash;and disaster had overtaken her.
Lettie Fournier had sinned ... and for all the years of
her subsequent life she had worn the name of Calvin
Stone. That this distinction brought her rival scant
happiness, was beside the point. The transgression of
the moral law was the barrier which both Lettie and
Eileen had passed to the kind of satisfaction that had
been denied her. Judith had not told her of the days
and nights of self-purging. She saw only externals, and
these were all in favour of the Browning theory. After
a long interval she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling her&mdash;Eileen&mdash;that I want
her to come to me? You know better how to get hold
of her. She thinks I don&#8217;t love her&mdash;that I&#8217;m partial to
Sylvia. I do love her ... and I want her at home with
me, where I can study her. It will be bitter enough
dose for me to take my lesson from her. But I am willing
to do it, if she can show me the way to happiness.&#8221;
She looked incredibly old and tired and hopeless. &#8220;And
would you mind lending me your copy of Browning? I
want to read &#8216;The Statue and the Bust&#8217; through. Sylvia
took mine with her when she moved to Detroit. I didn&#8217;t
think I would ever look at it again.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXIV &nbsp; Lavinia&#8217;s Credo</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>&#8220;Sister Judy,&#8221; Jack Denslow called, &#8220;there&#8217;s a bully
fire down the avenue. Come and watch the motor engine
go by. Good-bye, old horse, your day is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith Trench crossed to the window and stood beside
her young brother; but her mind was not on the marvel
of metal and speed that had gone from sight almost before
its clanging bell-note reached her ears. Another
fifth of March. A year ago ... Eileen ... there, in
that very room. And now.... Did Eileen remember?
Did any of the family remember? She and Lary had
spent the winter in New York, going to Springdale only
when business demanded, and each brief visit brought its
fresh surprise.</p>

<p>With the Marksley contract off his hands, David improved
in health so rapidly that he had long since ceased
to be a source of anxiety. Eileen and her mother had
effected an <i>entente cordiale</i> which apparently worked
well for both. The woman who had wrought the
bridge, however frail and inadequate, over which mother
and daughter might pass to an understanding hitherto
unknown in their association, reflected with grave misgivings
that the bridge was not the end of the journey.</p>

<p>Once she was on the point of telling Lary about his
mother, their sharp dispute and the subsequent ethical
discussion. The change in Lavinia, since that day, was
so marked that the neighbours made comment. The woman
who had spent her mature years surging from officious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
sweetness to the most violent outbursts of temper,
went about in a state of tranquil meditation that could
not be accounted for by anything external to herself.
There was none of the rapturous devotion to David that
had characterized her return from Bromfield; but at
least she was not unkind. Of all those who watched her,
only Judith could surmise what was going on in her mind.
Might it be that Lavinia had achieved her Indian Summer
without the killing frost? Had there, perhaps, been
a revision of her <i>credo</i> from the simple tenets of the catechism
to the complex philosophy of Robert Browning?
Judith shivered as she faced the thought and its possible
consequences.</p>

<p>She had told the troubled woman that sin consisted, not
in action, but in desire. Could Lavinia, literal-minded
and creed-ridden, handle a concept so foreign to her convictions?
Had Lary&#8217;s mother torn away the solid
foundation of her existence, and was she building again&mdash;a
substructure that would sustain her through the barren
years to come? Could this be done, at Lavinia&#8217;s age
and with the rigid material of Lavinia&#8217;s soul? Would
the house of her being come crashing down, when she
sought to shift from what she had been to what she hoped
to be?</p>

<p>Judith was glad when Lary told her, that evening, that
he must return to Springdale. Her mother-in-law might
seek counsel of her, in the privacy of the library where
their two natures had clashed again and yet again. All
the tedious journey to the West, she turned over in her
mind a working corollary to that elusive proposition, the
nature of sin. How tenuous, how like shifting sand, the
thought-mass on which our concrete actions must rest!
Had she any assurance that her conception of duty, of
principle, of right-thinking, was better for humanity than
the set of fatuous concepts she had sought to displace?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>If Lavinia had need of help, she gave no token. She
was at the station to meet them, and she was bursting
with a secret. There had been no mention of it in her
letters, because one could not be sure about such things&mdash;and
telling them in advance was likely to spoil the charm.
Then she sealed her lips until they were well within the
discreet walls of Vine Cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I may be mistaken; but unless I miss my
guess, there&#8217;s going to be a wedding before you go back
to New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wedding? Some one I have met?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! I was sure you didn&#8217;t suspect. Though
how you could have helped it&mdash;the way Syd acted, when
you were here the end of January&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Syd! I hope he has fallen in love wisely.
It would go hard with him if he should blunder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it will be all right. The difference in age
doesn&#8217;t matter&mdash;and you know he will make her a noble
husband. If only she doesn&#8217;t get some foolish notion of
telling him all that wretched affair. I tried to caution
her, in a roundabout way; but you know how stubborn
Eileen is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eileen!&#8221; Judith dropped a handful of toilet articles
on the dressing table and sat down, weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy, Judith!&#8221; The woman&#8217;s tone carried positive
contempt for such obtuseness. &#8220;He was with her every
evening while you and Larimore were here, the last time.
Of course they were reading Latin together, or working
with the violin. But I knew what it would lead to.
And it was my making her come home, after she&#8217;d been
at their house three evenings a week, that did it. He
missed her so dreadfully that he got over thinking about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
her as a little girl. Goodness knows, she&#8217;s more mature
than Sylvia was at twenty&mdash;and Syd will always be a
boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I wouldn&#8217;t look for her to do that. She&#8217;s
been very nice to me. Oh, Judith, I hope she will tell
you it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would be a great comfort to you to have
her happily married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but I wasn&#8217;t thinking so much about that part of
it. I had my own case in mind. It would be the last
straw of evidence&mdash;that all my old ideas were wrong.
For the first time in my life, I want to be sure I was in
the wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes glittered and her slender form seemed to dilate.
She was not thinking of her cruelty to Eileen and
her subsequent reluctance to admit that in her daughter&#8217;s
case good might grow out of evil. Eileen was become,
in her mother&#8217;s eyes, a manikin, to be posed this way and
that for the studying of effects&mdash;an architect&#8217;s drawing,
to serve as a pattern for the rebuilding of her mother&#8217;s
life.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Later in the day the girl came, her face wearing an expression
of deadly earnest. Already Mrs. Trench&#8217;s
hope was transformed into certainty. Judith led the
way to the little boudoir Lary had fitted for her on the
second floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear, what is it?&#8221; she asked when the door was
shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most important trouble I ever had. I ought to
have written you&mdash;when Syd first asked me. But I did
so want to tell papa first ... before even you. I owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
him that, for all the pain I caused him. Syd wants to be
married on my eighteenth birthday, and that&#8217;s less than
three weeks off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you love him, Eileen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I never thought it would be possible to love. We
just belong together&mdash;like you and Lary, only, oh, so different.
I can see it in a hundred ways. When I don&#8217;t
get what he&#8217;s trying to tell me&mdash;abstract ideas, you know&mdash;he
goes up to the landing in the reception hall and sits
down at his mother&#8217;s pipe organ and puts the thought
into something that I can get hold of. When a man can
talk to you that way&mdash;and music is the only language you
really do understand&mdash;there is only one answer. If I&#8217;m
in an ugly mood, he doesn&#8217;t scold or upbraid me. He
works out a theme in A-minor. I try to run away from
it, and I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve made bold to go past him, up to
my room, and my feet wouldn&#8217;t carry me up the stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, Eileen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cry it out on his shoulder. After I have washed the
meanness out, we can talk sense. I don&#8217;t mind in the
least&mdash;that he&#8217;s always right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s one point on which you can&#8217;t come to an
agreement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, only one. Judith, how far is it necessary to go
with confession of something that you know will lose you
the respect and affection of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Eileen, my poor little sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it hurt you,&#8221; the girl cried, her eyes filling.
&#8220;If life isn&#8217;t so perfect, I can stand it. There is one
thing more important than the man you love&mdash;and that is
your conviction of what is square and honest. Syd can
tell me what to do in other matters&mdash;but this is in your
line, not his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, it seems to me that there can be no sure foothold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in marriage if a wife conceals from her husband an
experience as important as that. I know what a humiliation
it is to open such a secret chamber. I did it,
Eileen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Judith, you don&#8217;t think I&mdash;&#8221; She stared, aghast.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t think me capable of taking Sydney Schubert&#8217;s
love&mdash;a man as clean and honourable as he is&mdash;without
telling him why I went to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he knows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew ... all along.&#8221; Her fair cheeks flamed.
&#8220;When he told me he cared, I said there was a reason
why I couldn&#8217;t ever marry any decent man. Judith, he
put his two arms around me and looked me square in the
eyes, and said: &#8216;You were a poor little wilful child, and
you didn&#8217;t know that fire would burn. Any woman, my
dear, is good enough for any man&mdash;if she is honest.&#8217;
The only thing he wanted to know was ... what we
had done with it. He said that would make a difference.
He was relieved when I told him. And he thinks you
were made in heaven&mdash;to have saved me&mdash;for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you have told him, and he is satisfied&mdash;what
is the obstacle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is his father. I can&#8217;t marry Syd and go there to
live, letting Papa Schubert believe I am the pure white
flower he thinks me. Syd says he won&#8217;t have his father&#8217;s
ideal of me shattered&mdash;because his father wouldn&#8217;t look
at it the way he does. He might forgive me: but I&#8217;d always
be tarnished, to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember, Eileen, the day you told the truth
to Laura Ramsay? You began by saying you were under
no moral obligation to her mother. I don&#8217;t know how
we can draw those lines of distinction; but I feel them
with absolute certainty. You are under no need to confess
your secret to Sylvia or Theodora&mdash;and for widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
different reasons. Indeed we must go to any length to
prevent Theo ever learning the truth. With Dr. Schubert
it is the same. It would only give him useless pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Syd said. He led me over to that little
peachblow vase&mdash;the one that was bequeathed to his
father by one of his grateful patients. He told me the
satin glaze and the peachbloom tints were the result of
the heat in the kiln, that almost destroyed the body of
the vase. He asked me if I would be willing to break
that little amphora, that his father loves, just to prove to
him that it isn&#8217;t as perfect on the inside as it looks to him.
He might patch the fragments together, but he would
always be conscious of the cracks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Syd is right. It would be brutality&mdash;sheer vandalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You precious treasure. He told me that was what
you would say. Now I am going to the office to tell my
darling daddy that he is to have a <i>real</i> son-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to tell your mother, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Syd&#8217;s job. He is going to make formal application
for my hand. He can get off a thing like that,
without batting an eye, when he&#8217;s just dying to get out
and yell. And the worst of it is, mamma&#8217;ll take it in
dead earnest. I suppose Sylvia will have sarcastic things
to say. I don&#8217;t care. Syd never was really in love with
her&mdash;after he was old enough to cut his eye teeth.&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Mrs. Penrose did not come home for the wedding.
Just what she wrote her mother, the other members of
the family never knew. Her letter came with another,
which bore the Bromfield postmark, and the two were on
Lavinia&#8217;s plate when she came down to breakfast.
David and the girls were already at the table, and Theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
had inspected the mail. Drusilla had been instructed not
to take letters from the box, and the sight of two thick envelopes
threw Lavinia into a nervous chill. She picked
them up and carried them to the sun room, saying she
had a headache and would eat nothing.</p>

<p>After a little, David followed her, distressed. &#8220;Is
there anything wrong in Bromfield&mdash;at your brother&#8217;s
house, or with my people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing the matter in Bromfield. Sylvia is
a cat!&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXV &nbsp; The Credo at Work</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>When school closed in June, Judith took Theodora
for the long promised visit to New York. Sydney and
Eileen were off for a belated honeymoon in the mountains
of Colorado, and Lavinia Trench reflected that the
coveted privacy had come at the crucial moment. She
would be alone to think things out. David was away
from home much of the time, and when he was in the
house his wife was only mechanically conscious of his
presence. She viewed the neighbours as through a mist.
Orders were given to Drusilla, with the monotonous intonation
of a talking machine. That the orders were
rational was evidence of the complete detachment that
could enable her mind to function without conscious effort.
It was as if she had wound up the machinery of
her being and had withdrawn, leaving it to the old familiar
routine.</p>

<p>After three weeks, her cloistered retreat was invaded
by the most disturbing member of her family. The
passionate devotion that had centered in her youngest-born&mdash;to
her purblind vision the most perfect copy of
herself&mdash;had undergone insidious change, as she centered
her interest in Eileen. Theodora was irritating beyond
endurance. With the child in the house, there could be
no peace. Reluctantly, almost bitterly, she came back
to the dull reality of life. David was still in Jacksonville
from Monday to Saturday. After a day or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
she consented to let Theo stay with Dr. Schubert and
Nanny. To her daughter-in-law she confessed that it
was not because the old doctor was so lonely, but that she
could not endure the child&#8217;s incessant chatter. The
dropping of a fork behind her chair would send her into
a paroxysm of shaking&mdash;Lavinia, who had always
laughed at nervous women.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>One morning Judith stood with her husband at an
upper window, watching the agitated woman as she
paced up and down before the house. The postman was
late.</p>

<p>&#8220;She watched for him just that way yesterday, Lary.
And when he failed to bring what she was expecting, her
disappointment was pitiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother is going through some deep transition. I
wish I could help her; but she has always shut me out.
She is a hundred times more frank and confidential with
you than she has ever been with me or with her own
daughters. Do you think, dear, you could induce her to
tell you what is troubling her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried. She talks freely about the emptiness
and misery of her life. She is gnawingly unsatisfied; but
she gives no clue. Such devotion as your father&#8217;s ought
to have won her, years ago. I spoke rather plainly to
her about it. I knew it would anger her; but I wanted
to shock her into some line of rational thinking. The
mention of her husband&#8217;s tenderness only infuriated her.
She said such cruel things about him. And, Lary, he is as
much in the dark as we are. He talked to me about it,
Sunday night. Is it possible....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered if there might be something in her life&mdash;long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
ago&mdash;a scar that is still sensitive&mdash;some shock that
left a buried impression.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lover, you mean? I hardly think so. She has
always teased or brutally insulted my father with the
mention of an old sweetheart of hers. It seems, they
were deadly rivals, and papa won her because of his clean
morals. The other man was the rakish sort&mdash;and in a
town like Bromfield&mdash;with my mother&#8217;s prejudices and
the thing that in her case passes for religious conviction....&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the postman rounded the corner. There
was only one letter for the Trench household, but its
effect was electrical. Lavinia took it from his hand and
ran stumbling into the house. At the sill she dropped to
her knees, regained her footing and hurried inside. She
had not opened the envelope, hence its contents could not
account for her perturbed state of mind. It came to
Judith ... that the whole future hung on the tenor of
a reply.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>At noon she appeared in the dining-room of Vine
Cottage. Her cheeks were pasty, ashen, but her eyes
burned with insane luster. She must send an important
letter to Sylvia, and it was too late&mdash; She floundered,
catching a chair for support. Would Larimore send
the office boy out with a special delivery stamp?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your letter with me, and post it at the office,&#8221;
Lary said, annoyed by the crafty manner that
marked his mother&#8217;s too frequent subterfuges.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t written it yet. It isn&#8217;t the kind I could
dash off in a minute. Sylvia wants me to be in Detroit
by Friday noon. I&#8217;ll have to get word&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa won&#8217;t be home until Saturday evening,&#8221; her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
said sharply. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go off without consulting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word &#8220;consulting&#8221; was unfortunate. It released
a flood of martyrdom. Lavinia thought she owed a
duty to her daughter that must outweigh any consideration
or demand on the part of her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see my sister&#8217;s letter. If there is anything
serious, I can telephone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring it with me. In fact, I accidentally
dropped it in the grate and it was burned before I could
get it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A grate fire in July?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was burning some scraps&mdash;and it got mixed with
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going away until papa comes home. It
isn&#8217;t fair to him&mdash;and if you insist&mdash;I shall call Sylvia
by long distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith averted her eyes. The sight of her mother-in-law&#8217;s
baffled fury was more than she could endure.
In the end the woman agreed to defer her trip until Saturday
night. She would write Sylvia that she could not
be spared from home.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Early Friday morning she came with another request.
She had a letter from her husband which she handed to
Lary, ostentatiously. David was entirely willing that she
should go to Detroit. In fact, he had promised Sylvia
that they together would visit her as soon as the housecleaning
and redecorating of the apartment was over.
He would have earned a vacation when the Jacksonville
contract was finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Larimore, if you will look after the ticket&mdash;and
the sleeper berth&mdash;I&#8217;ll only take a suit case, and your
father can bring what I need in his trunk. By that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll know about the weather, and what kind of clothes I
need. I want the ticket via Chicago. It&#8217;s so much
shorter than the other route.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicago?&#8221; Something feline, insinuating, in her
tone arrested him. &#8220;There&#8217;s no direct route from
Springdale to Detroit via Chicago. You would have to
go to Littlefield and wait there for the St. Louis train&mdash;and
in Chicago it would mean going from one station
to the other. The last time you tried that, you got
lost, and missed your connection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must&mdash;that is, I&#8217;d prefer to go that way. It
wouldn&#8217;t matter if I did miss my train. Sylvia wants me
to do some shopping for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shopping on Sunday, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>As the woman hurried from her son&#8217;s presence, Judith
heard her mutter: &#8220;There&#8217;s more than one way to kill
a cat.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Saturday was consumed with the endless little things
that went to the preparation for a journey. At noon
Lavinia sent Dutton out to post a letter to Sylvia. It
was plastered over the upper third with a combination
of pink and green stamps. Lavinia Trench abhorred
that sort of thing; but she would not ask Larimore for a
proper stamp to insure Sunday delivery of her letter.
She shunned him with an animosity that was not to be
misinterpreted. He had angered her profoundly. She
told Judith that she would go to the station in Hafferty&#8217;s
cab and wait there until David came in. In such a case
he would not mind sitting with her until her train arrived.
She had evidently asked too many favours of her son.
She had always supposed that sons were glad to serve
their mothers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Judith sought to analyse the woman&#8217;s torn state of
mind. Did she always get into such a fever when she
was going away from home? Lavinia had travelled
much, in spite of her oft repeated assertion that she never
went anywhere, never had any pleasure ... nothing
but the dull drudgery of a wife and mother. Before her
visit to Bromfield she had been in just such a mental state.
But was it, exactly, this condition of mind? Two years
ago, everything that Lavinia did&mdash;every subterfuge,
every veiled speech or cruel innuendo&mdash;was carefully
thought out. It all had a direct bearing on the main object.
She must go to Bromfield, and she would not admit
to her family&mdash;nor indeed to herself&mdash;that she had
need to go. From infancy she had been devious, approaching
her goal by the most tortuous path. She was
this way in her housekeeping. One could not be a
martyr if things were easy. The simple, natural way
was hateful to her&mdash;the refuge of lazy wives.</p>

<p>This much Judith had set down, in her effort to understand
her mother-in-law&#8217;s curiously warped psychology.
But now there was a new phase. The episode of Sylvia&#8217;s
letter, accidentally burned in the grate on a steaming July
day, sufficed to betray a significant breaking-up of the
tough fibre of an irrational but tremendously efficient
mind. The mycelium of decay&mdash;some deadly fungus&mdash;had
penetrated the heartwood of Lavinia Trench&#8217;s being.
She went into a panic at the slightest turn in her
plans. She no longer counted upon the unforeseen contingency,
or guarded against it. That that crashing letter&mdash;the
occasion for this hurried trip to Detroit&mdash;was
not from Sylvia, Judith was morally certain. From
whom, then? She laid the perplexity wearily aside.
With one unknown quantity, she might have solved the
equation. Here were two unknown and unknowable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
quantities, since Lavinia&mdash;after her two disastrous blunders&mdash;refused
to talk except in monosyllables.</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>When the suit case was in process of preparation,
Judith invaded Mrs. Trench&#8217;s bedroom. She brought
a dark negligée for the Pullman, in place of the delicate
one that Sylvia had ridiculed, two years ago. As she offered
it, her mother-in-law turned furtively to conceal
something she was in the act of securing in the bottom
of her small travelling bag. Her fingers caught at the
edge of a night-dress, awkwardly, and the thing was revealed
... the borrowed volume of Browning.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVI &nbsp; Consummation</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>A brief, unsatisfactory letter came Monday noon,
while David was having luncheon at Vine Cottage. It
was written on Pullman paper, in a loose scrawl. The
train was four hours late, and of course there was no one
at the station to meet her. But then, she had not expected
to be met. Everything would be all right, she
was sure. It was frightfully hot in Detroit. She would
not write again until Tuesday evening, since she and Sylvia
would be up to the ears in housecleaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, somehow, feel that things are right,&#8221; David
said, returning the envelope to his pocket and drawing
out another. &#8220;Vine acted so strange while we were
waiting in the station. I thought I ought to go along to
take care of her&mdash;but this work in the office is so pressing&mdash;and
I&#8217;m just compelled to go to Jacksonville for part
of the week. I told her, if she needed me....&#8221; He
halted, his eyes receding. &#8220;She flared out at me so
fiercely that I didn&#8217;t say another word. That&#8217;s where
I ought to have been firm. But I never could understand
your mother, Lary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us does, papa. What is the other letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s from Sylvia. I found it at the office.&#8221; Larimore
read aloud:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<i>Dear Papa</i>:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing in a hurry, so that you can do me a favour.
Mamma&#8217;s special has just arrived, saying she can&#8217;t reach Detroit
until Tuesday noon&mdash;that you and Lary have upset all her plans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Well, now, please, <i>please</i>, <small>PLEASE</small> upset them some more. Not
that I don&#8217;t want her to visit me; but it is terribly inconvenient
now. The place is torn up with painters and paper-hangers. The
weather is a fright&mdash;and Oliver cross as a bear. Mamma says
she must be here to help me. But you know how I hate to have
her around when I have anything important to do. If you can
induce her to wait a week&mdash;really, I&#8217;m afraid Oliver won&#8217;t be civil
to her, in his present mood&mdash;you&#8217;ll do her and us a big service.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Your affectionate Daughter,<br />

<span class="smcap">Sylvia</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Four days of agonized suspense, during which&mdash;at
Lary&#8217;s urgent request&mdash;David abstained from replying
to either of the letters ... and Lavinia Trench came
home. She walked into the house, a tottering old woman.
Theo and her father were in the dining-room, trying
to choke down Drusilla&#8217;s tempting dinner, and they
started from the table as if an apparition from the dead
had confronted them. She was dusty and disheveled.
The close travelling hat hung limp over one eye, and
through the greenish-gray of her cheeks the bones were
modelled remorselessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what has happened to you, Vine? Have you
been in a wreck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A wreck? Oh, yes, a wreck. Everything is a
wreck.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank into a chair and sat staring at the floor.
After a moment she collected herself to ask: &#8220;Has Sylvia
written?&#8221; And then: &#8220;<i>What</i> has Sylvia written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;except the letter she sent before you got
there. She wanted you to wait until she was through
with her housecleaning&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all about that! David Trench, if you ever
speak to that unprincipled girl, I&#8217;ll....&#8221; Lavinia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
glared, her heart pounding visibly. &#8220;She ... I might
have known what to expect, after the letter she wrote
when Syd and Eileen were married. She&#8217;s worse than
Eileen, a hundred times worse. She&#8217;s capable&mdash;of lying&mdash;about
her own mother. She&#8217;ll try to lie out of this
thing. You can&#8217;t depend on a word she says. And
Oliver&#8217;s as unprincipled as she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>In times of stress it had always been a source of relief
to Lavinia to talk&mdash;to abuse some one. More often
than not, David was the victim. Now she was hardly
conscious of his presence. Theodora she did not see at
all. She was sunk in the morass of her own misery, a
misery so devastating that her worst enemy must have
pitied her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Sylvia unkind to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unkind? I like the way you pick your words!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry, Vine. You must make allowances for
the hot weather&mdash;and Oliver&#8217;s uncertain temper. Sylvia
had enough to upset her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no excuse for treating her mother in such a
shameful way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went up to her room and shut herself in. From
behind a curtain she watched while David went to the
cottage to consult his son. There was no train arriving
from Detroit at that hour of the day. It later developed
that Lavinia had left the train at Littlefield, and that her
travel-stained appearance was the result of a rough ride
in a service car. David had often come home that way,
when he had contracts in Pana and Sullivan. He knew,
too, that it was the Chicago train; but the fact was without
significance for him.</p>

<p>When the woman had calmed herself somewhat, she
told a more or less coherent story. She had foolishly
tried to surprise Sylvia&mdash;had pictured her daughter&#8217;s delight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
when she should walk in, unannounced, on the heels
of the letter that deferred her coming until Tuesday.
She went to the apartment in a cab and rang the bell.
There was no one at home. She returned to the station
and wrote the letter to David&mdash;she would not have told
him for the world that she was greeted by locked doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go right to the janitor, my dear?&#8221;
David asked, tenderly. &#8220;You know Oliver and Sylvia
often go out on the lake, Sundays, when it&#8217;s hot. And&mdash;it
just occurs to me&mdash;are you sure you went to the right
place?&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith, watching the unfoldment of the story from a
vantage point that was not David&#8217;s, thought the woman
clutched eagerly at a plank she had hitherto not seen.
She gained a precious interval of thought, while her lips
retorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think I ought to know Sylvia&#8217;s address.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but those great apartment houses all look alike.
You might not even have been on the right street. You
know, once when you went to St. Louis&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but that time I took the wrong car line. It was
the fault of the policeman who directed me. I&#8217;d think
a cabman would know the streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Sylvia say&mdash;when you finally&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say? She didn&#8217;t say anything. She
wouldn&#8217;t let me in. I tried to telephone her from the
hotel, Monday morning&mdash;and I&#8217;m morally certain it was
Oliver who answered the &#8217;phone. When I said it was
mother, he said I had the wrong number, and hung up.
I tried again, and they wouldn&#8217;t answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when you went back to the house&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went three times&mdash;and once I know I saw Sylvia
peeping through the curtain at the apartment door. She
didn&#8217;t want me there, and she wouldn&#8217;t let me in.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call Sylvia up and ask her what she
means by&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia leaped across the room and fell upon her husband,
forcing him roughly into his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort. Haven&#8217;t I been humiliated
enough already?&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>They were interrupted by the clanging of bells, on
Sherman avenue. Judith went to the window, to report
that a cloud of smoke was visible against the western sky.
A moment later, Dutton called from the lawn that the
Marksley house was burning. Theodora wanted to see
the fun. He would drive her out, if her father and
brother were willing. They were not willing!</p>

<p>Dutton&#8217;s disappointment was greater than Theo&#8217;s, albeit
she would have revelled in the sight of that one particular
fire. Dutton could not make out why people kept
a car, if they were too stingy to use it. Nothing ever
happened in Springdale, and when there was a little excitement,
a fellow wasn&#8217;t allowed to enjoy it.</p>

<p>But the spectacle would hardly have been worth the
exertion of cranking the car. The Monday paper gave
a graphic account of the blaze that started in the store
room on the top floor, and was extinguished before it had
accomplished more than partial destruction of the roof.
The damage was amply covered by insurance. It was
understood that Mr. David Trench would investigate
the loss, and make necessary repairs, at the insistence of
the insurance company.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XXXVII &nbsp; In the &#8220;Personal&#8221;
Column</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>Early Thursday morning, David was on the point of
going out to the Marksley Addition to estimate the fire
loss, when he stopped at sight of Judith, entering her own
gate. He crossed the parched grass of the wide lawn
and joined her. Once before he had hinted that his
wife&#8217;s mind might be failing&mdash;that the shock of Eileen&#8217;s
tragedy and the consequent relief of her propitious marriage
might have unsettled her mother&#8217;s reason. He
had talked to Dr. Schubert about it, but had elicited no
sympathy for his theory. The physician did not believe
for a moment that Sylvia&mdash;in spite of the evidential letter
to her father&mdash;had refused to open the door or to
answer the telephone. Sylvia was entirely absorbed in
herself, but she was not a fool. He was rather taken
with the belief that Lavinia had been playing some sort
of prank on her family. A born play-actor, she grew
weary of the burden of actuality, and sought relief&mdash;excitement&mdash;in
a world of make-believe. This time she
had miscalculated, and found things hard to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said one thing that went against the grain, Judith,
even from Dr. Schubert. He said that when we make a
lifelong practice of petty deception, we don&#8217;t gain the
facility we gain by any other constant exercise; but instead,
we grow reckless, until we are unable to know
truth from falsehood. Then we overreach ourselves.
I accept the fact&mdash;but I don&#8217;t like to think that Vine
would deliberately&mdash;lie to me. She doesn&#8217;t always see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
things in their true relations. But that she would make
up a lie ... I can&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly you can&#8217;t, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the sheer curtains of her bedroom window
Lavinia watched them&mdash;Lavinia who through five days
of shifting from one detail to another had maintained
the mystery of her fruitless visit. What were they saying?
She strained her keen ears, to catch only a muffled
note of solicitude. Now the postman loomed in sight.
The ubiquitous postman! If he had not delivered that
letter.... In her rage, she began to abuse the postman
for her wretchedness, the collapse of her iridescent
bubble of happiness. He was putting into David&#8217;s hand
some letters and a paper, the Bromfield Sentinel. She
had forgotten that this was Thursday. She saw her husband
open the crude little sheet and glance at the Personal
Column, where he so often found news of a friend
he had not seen since his wedding day. A long agony
of waiting ... and David thrust the paper into Judith&#8217;s
hand and walked rapidly away, a strange look on his
transparent face.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>What had he seen in the column of village gossip?
Lavinia was conscious that a hornets&#8217; nest had been rent
asunder, above her head. A hundred furious possibilities
buzzed in her ears. Stumbling in wild agitation to the
deep closet of her room, she took a leather-bound volume
from her Gladstone, where it had lain since her return
from Detroit. Without opening it, she fled in a panic to
Vine Cottage&mdash;burst into the breakfast-room, with a
fine show of indignation, and flung the book on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! I&#8217;m done with that thing. Browning&#8217;s a
fool!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you have found him unprofitable. He
isn&#8217;t easy reading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have as much sense as you or Mrs. Henderson.
You made me believe he told the truth. I hate a liar.
I never told a lie in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask you to take the volume,&#8221; Judith said
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but you made me believe there was something in
it&mdash;something that was an improvement on the
Bible....&#8221;</p>

<p>Her daughter-in-law took up the offender and carried
it to the library. When she returned, there was a
precipitate relapse into a chair. Lavinia had improved
the interval to look for the Sentinel. It was not in the
room. A bitter tirade poured from her purple lips.
There was no use in people trying to shirk responsibility.
David had always done it. So had Larimore. They
continually placed her in untenable situations and then
left her to bear the consequences alone. She had had
to rear the family single-handed, to take all the responsibility
for their moral and financial welfare. If it had
not been for her, they might have been criminals or
tramps. David had never concerned himself for her
... or them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I can&#8217;t listen to such outrageous injustice.
I have never seen a more considerate husband than
father is to you. Even Lary, with all his tenderness, and
his perfect comradeship, has his eyes on himself most
of the time. Father never thinks of himself. His
whole heart is given to you and his children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and he hangs over me until he drives me to distraction.
I&#8217;ll tell him where I have been&mdash;if he doesn&#8217;t
stop following me about&mdash;as if I hadn&#8217;t a right to go
where I please.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Lavinia&#8217;s usual solvent, a flood of tears, failed her.
Dry-eyed she left the room, forgetting to ask for the
paper, which had been the real object of her call. Judith
returned to the library and took down the volume of
Browning. In some unfathomable way it was responsible
for the distressing situation. As she turned the
pages, pencil marks caught her eye. A line, a word or
two, in some instances an entire stanza had been underscored.
They were, without exception, love passages.
Well over towards the back, a sheet of note paper came
to view, covered with Lavinia&#8217;s tight, precise writing.
If Browning <i>would</i> change the subject, just when you
thought you had grasped his meaning ... at least, you
could fling your net over the elusive concept and carry it
away&mdash;isolate it from the confusing wealth of context.</p>

<p>But no! This was more than random copying.
Widely separated passages had been woven together into
a kind of confession of faith ... like lemon jelly in
a mould. Judith, as she read, forgot that she was looking
into another woman&#8217;s soul, forgot Lavinia, in the
fascination of following the curious windings of Lavinia&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Come back with me to the first of all. Let us lean and love
it over again. Let us now forget and now recall, and gather
what we let fall. Each life&#8217;s incomplete, you see. I follow where
I am led, knowing so well the leader&#8217;s hand. Oh, woman, wooed,
not wed! When we loved each other, lived and loved the same,
till an evening came when a shaft from the devil&#8217;s bow pierced
to our ingle-glow, and the friends were friend and foe. Never
fear but there&#8217;s provision of the devils to quench knowledge, lest
we walk the earth in rapture&mdash;making those who catch God&#8217;s secret
just so much more prize their capture. The true end, sole and
single, we stop here for is this love-way with some other soul to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
mingle. How is it under our control to love or not to love?
Heart, shall we live or die? The rest ... settle by and by.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Judith laid the sheet in its place and returned
the volume to the bookcase. Yes, David was right.
But what a weird obsession! Lavinia, out of the
pregnant depths of her misery, had fashioned a lover to
her liking, a phantom lover, to be communed with in
secret. Had she gone to Detroit, not to visit Sylvia,
but to seek some fantastic realization of her yearning for
the perfect romance? Why had she come home, shattered
and undone. A real man ... the man she met
in the Pullman when she was returning from Bromfield&mdash;the
man who had fallen in love with her?</p>

<p>She paused beside the table where, an hour ago, she
had laid the Bromfield paper. She looked at it with
vacant eyes, striving to clarify her turbid thoughts.
Gradually, out of the emptiness, words came up to her,
the words that David had read, at the head of the
&#8220;personal&#8221; column.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Our distinguished citizen, Mr. Calvin Stone, has just returned
from a ten days&#8217; business trip to Chicago.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The room with its delicate furnishings faded, as when
the lights are suddenly turned off. Judith stared, her
heart leaping in unrhythmic cadence, her eyes following
the monstrous panorama that unrolled before her.
Long ago she had gone to a little cinema theatre with
Lary and the girls, where black dots had danced on a
white screen. Black dots were dancing now, on the
white screen of her memory.</p>

<p>A dozen disjointed fragments of conversation; an
old story her grandmother had told her, of a secret
wedding in Rochester; Lavinia&#8217;s greedy interest in the
story, in all that pertained to Calvin and Lettie Stone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
her determination to revisit Bromfield the summer
following Mrs. Stone&#8217;s death; the miracle of her regeneration
when she returned home; the yellow pallor
on her face when she put the question: &#8220;Do people ever
really get over things?&#8221; The dots had woven
themselves into a succession of preliminary shapes, and
all at once the picture was complete. Lavinia&#8217;s secret
lay bare before her daughter-in-law&#8217;s gaze.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Outside on the street there was commotion. Judith
was aroused from her torpor of pain by Lavinia
Trench&#8217;s voice, strident and hysterical:</p>

<p>&#8220;Carry him into the west room. You can&#8217;t take him
upstairs on that stretcher. What has happened to him?
Why didn&#8217;t you telephone me? David, are you alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>David had fallen from the roof of the Marksley house.
No one knew what had caused the accident. He was
standing on a wide ledge, that ought to have been secure.
One of the workmen saw him stagger, reel backward and
come crashing down. It was fortunate that he did not
strike the stone pavement. That would have been
fatal. He was apparently only stunned by the fall.</p>

<p>Judith followed the curious crowd into the house and
bent above the stricken man, while his wife ran panting
up the stairs to prepare his bed. He opened his eyes
and his lips fashioned inarticulate words.</p>

<p>&#8220;The paper,&#8221; she saw rather than heard, &#8220;the paper
... burn it. I saw&mdash;in a flash&mdash;that blinded me&mdash;and
I fell....&#8221;</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>The consulting surgeon was still upstairs with Dr.
Schubert and the nurse. In the sun-room, the Venetian
blinds drawn to shut out the hot July rays, the
family sat, awaiting the verdict. Sydney and Eileen had
hurried home from the West in response to a conservative
telegram from Lary. Sylvia and her husband were
already there. The meeting of the sisters was reserved,
befitting the occasion. Now Sylvia forgot her father&mdash;her
growing resentment because of the general misunderstanding
with regard to her mother&#8217;s alleged visit&mdash;as she
gazed across the spacious room at the beautiful young
woman whom she could with difficulty accept as Mrs.
Sydney Schubert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; she whispered to Oliver.
&#8220;You know what a raw, scraggy girl she was when we
left here. I couldn&#8217;t make out what Hal Marksley saw
in her. But for Syd&mdash;he had such an eye for beauty.
He never went with a girl who was plain or homely.
Mamma never wrote us how she had changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you a long time ago,&#8221; her husband retorted,
&#8220;that the ugly duckling had a way of growing into the
swan of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sylvia flushed, annoyed, and lapsed into silence.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Outside the passer-by paused to look curiously at the
house. David Trench hovered between life and death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and the town forgot the summer heat in its anxious
sympathy. No one had known what a great man he was,
what an irreparable loss his death would mean to the
community. All over the town little groups of prominent
men discussed the catastrophe with hushed breathing.
The labourers who had done David&#8217;s bidding for years
wiped furtive tears from their eyes when they were told
that the case was all but hopeless.</p>

<p>Fifty&mdash;the meridian of life! A younger man would
stand a better chance. Dr. Schubert feared a spinal
lesion. Yet the shock to the nervous system might
account for the torpor that had prevailed, with fleeting
lucid intervals, for four days. If that were all, the
human machine would right itself presently.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning Mr. Marksley had come to the
house to inquire about the patient, and to repudiate any
responsibility for the accident ... and had encountered
Lavinia Trench&#8217;s tongue in a manner that he was not
likely to forget. She had another score to settle with
this man and his family, unnamed but not absent from
the motive power of her attack. The outburst had a
salutary effect on the woman who, after the first excitement
of David&#8217;s home-coming, had moved with the
automatism of a sleep-walker. When he had gone, she
sought Judith. Larimore must go at once and arrange
with Dr. Schubert for consultation, the best surgeon in
St. Louis.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>When they were alone, she fell on her daughter-in-law&#8217;s
neck, sobbing hysterically: &#8220;Oh, oh, oh, if he dies I shall
go distracted. He doesn&#8217;t dare to die ... now. If he
was going to die, why couldn&#8217;t it have been sooner? Oh,
my God in heaven, what am I saying? Judith, can&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
save him? Don&#8217;t you know what it would mean for him
to die now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to be calm, mother. The case isn&#8217;t quite
desperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but my case is desperate. You don&#8217;t know....
If you could have heard him, last night! He said the
most terrible thing. He must have been thinking it, or
it wouldn&#8217;t have slipped out like that, when his mind
was wandering. When you think a thing over and over,
you say it without meaning to. He took my hands and
said he was only a carpenter&#8217;s son ... but Ch&mdash;rist was
a carpenter&#8217;s son, too ... and it was worth carrying a
cross all these years, to have me, when I belonged to
another man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother! Oh, this is pitiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to get down on my knees and tell him that I
never belonged to any other man. I wanted to confess
that I was the vilest sinner, and unworthy of his love.
It wasn&#8217;t me, at all. I was standing to one side, looking
at David and me, and thinking what I would do it I was
in Vine Larimore&#8217;s place. And when I walked away,
there didn&#8217;t seem to be any floor under my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, dear, why didn&#8217;t you open your heart to him,
when you were so close?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried, beating back the suggestion with
baffled hands. &#8220;You never had David look at you with
condemnation. Oh, I would rather have him slap my
face. I could resent that. But to have him condemn&mdash;and
then forgive....&#8221; She swayed weakly, all her
force concentrated in the relentless mouth. &#8220;Judith, if
he dies, it will be on my head. You told me that it was
as bad to sin in thought as to carry out the desire.
I wanted to kill David. Don&#8217;t look at me like that. I
have to tell you. There is no one else I can trust&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
I&#8217;ll babble it, when I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m talking, if I don&#8217;t
get it out of my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twice I tried. Once when you were in Europe&mdash;when
his health was so poor&mdash;and I was going to give him
the wrong medicine. And six weeks ago, when he
brought a lot of money home&mdash;and I thought it would
look as if a burglar did it. It was just after you took
Theo to New York, and we were alone in the house. At
the last moment, my courage failed. But if he dies, I
will be held accountable for his murder. Judith, he has
to live. Don&#8217;t you see....&#8221;</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>And thus it came about that the great specialist had
been sent for. Already he had been up there in David&#8217;s
room for more than an hour. Now a door was opening,
two pairs of feet were descending the stairs. Before
those in the sun-room realized it, the distinguished man
had passed to the waiting cab and was gone. Lavinia
was on her feet, aquiver with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he going? I want to ask him a hundred
questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has told me everything you need to know,&#8221; the old
family physician told her sternly. &#8220;He will send us
another nurse from St. Louis&mdash;a young man capable of
handling a dead weight. My diagnosis, unfortunately,
was correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will he get well?&#8221; Lavinia&#8217;s lips were blue and her
eyes protruded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must wait and see. He will be paralysed from
the waist down.&#8221;</p>

<p>David to sit in a wheel-chair the rest of his life!
Vine staggered from the room. Her daughter-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
followed, fearful for one or the other of those two actors
in life&#8217;s sorry drama. But the stricken woman only
paused an instant at her husband&#8217;s door, and passed on
to the performance of some commonplace duty. Judith
returned to the lower hall, to hear Dr. Schubert say:</p>

<p>&#8220;He begged me not to let them prolong his life. Said
it was wrong to hang on, when he had finished his task.
He would have a fighting chance, if he had the least recuperative
desire. David doesn&#8217;t want to get well. He
said that death was nothing to be afraid of&mdash;after a man
had lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sees an honourable way out of the hell he has had
for thirty years,&#8221; Syd muttered, his blue eyes wrathful,
his slender hands clenched. &#8220;I hope there is a heaven&mdash;that
he&#8217;s so sure of. We know what it would be for him
here, chained down to a pair of helpless legs. All his
life he has walked away from it, when he had taken all
he could endure. It would break Eileen&#8217;s heart to see
her father&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the kitchen Drusilla burst all at once into song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;God moves in a mysterious way</div>
<div class="indent">His wonders to perform.</div>
<div class="verse">He plants His footsteps in the sea</div>
<div class="indent">And rides upon the storm.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The nurse hurried down to check the stridulous singing,
and to say that Mr. Trench wanted to see his two
daughters, Judith and Eileen, together. The specialist
had said it would do him no harm to talk quietly with his
family.</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>At the threshold Eileen asked, her face white with
grief: &#8220;Judith, did I do this? Am I to blame for his
fall? Last night he told Theo that when he was up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
that ledge, he saw something. And the pity and horror
of it made him lose his footing. The poor baby thought
he meant the burning of that ugly gable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what he had in mind, dear. You can go to
him without a pang of regret.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later the girl was kneeling at her father&#8217;s
side. There was no blemish on the beautiful face, no
wasting, as of disease, and the blue eyes smiled tenderly,
their smile changing to protest, as she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, papa, this is the hardest part of my punishment&mdash;to
know that I made you suffer. If only I had known!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You brought me the only real happiness of my life.
It was worth all I paid. When I saw you&mdash;the day you
came home from Europe&mdash;I almost died of joy. And
when I heard you give your vow to Sydney, I said: &#8216;My
cup runneth over.&#8217; I know now why Sylvia had to treat
him so cruelly. I asked God to make her realize his
worth. What foolish children we are, when we pray.
I knew the sorrow of his boyhood, and how pure his heart
was. Eileen, none of us knew that he had to minister
to a gentle, afflicted mother, all those years ... just to
fit him to be your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa!&#8221; The girl&#8217;s tears wet her father&#8217;s face.
&#8220;And only you could have seen it. There isn&#8217;t another
man in the world who could have taken me&mdash;without
ever humiliating me&mdash;and made me want to be the best
woman that ever lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t ever forget that men need love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They need it more than we do. Perhaps I can make
up some of what I owe you&mdash;when I take care of Syd&#8217;s
father ... make his home bright and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>David stroked her hand, his eyes wandering to the face
of Judith who stood, shaken with emotion, at the foot of
the bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>&#8220;Come to me, dear daughter. I have something to
tell you, while I have my wits about me. It may be our
last chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman pressed her hand to her quivering chin,
as the sobs surged up in her throat. Then she hid her
face in the pillow, her cheek close to the dear face, so that
David could whisper in her ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;You took care of the paper? You won&#8217;t let her know
I saw it? After I am gone, she can go to him and be
happy. I forgive them, as Christ has forgiven me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! Now I can believe there <i>was</i> a Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t her fault, Judith. You were never harsh
with Eileen. You must not be harsh with her. She was
too brilliant for me. I was never anything but a drag.
I was too stupid to understand, when she told me I had
won her away from him. If I had had any wit&mdash;but I
did love her so!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not a wail of regret. Just a simple statement
of fact. He had bought a priceless treasure and had
paid for it with the sorrow of the loveless years. He
looked up, to see Eileen gazing in troubled wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to say so much; but I believe it would
be all right for you to tell her&mdash;about her mother. If
it was right for Eileen&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t have been wrong
for her mother. We can&#8217;t see the flowers when we
put the ugly bulbs into the ground. Perhaps her own
child can help you show her the path.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, I can&#8217;t endure it,&#8221; Judith cried. &#8220;It was
I who blundered. I tried to show her the way. I
didn&#8217;t know what her ailment was. I opened the wrong
medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave her your best. That&#8217;s all any of us can
do. You and Eileen and I have suffered; but for my
poor Vine it is terrible. She had so much love to give,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and it was all sealed up in her heart until it&mdash;putrified&mdash;poisoned
her. Tell her that she was not to blame.
Tell her that ... Christ died ... to make others
... happy....&#8221;</p>

<p>The words trailed off in a half audible whisper, and
David Trench slept.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">XXXIX &nbsp; Lavinia</h3></div>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>It was the largest funeral Springdale had ever seen.
Lavinia reflected, with grim pride, that not even President
Henderson had called forth so many or such
magnificent floral tributes. Dr. Clarkson conducted the
simple service and the Conservatory Quartette sang the
old sweet songs that David loved. With uncovered
heads his townsmen stood by while his tired body sank
to rest. Then life went on as before.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Lavinia and Theodora were alone in the big house
with Drusilla. Lary thought it absurd for them to
occupy so much room. He would be going to New
York in the early fall, now that Springdale had nothing
to hold him. His mother might as well return to Vine
Cottage. She had built the great Colonial house in order
to make a propitious marriage for Sylvia. A similar
need would never confront her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Move into this little place? Indeed I shall do
nothing of the sort. In fact, I have made up my mind
to go back to Bromfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bromfield?&#8221; The tone carried something dangerously
like a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;The town was good enough for your grandparents,&#8221;
his mother retorted hotly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have a relative
left here but Eileen, and she will certainly never be any
comfort to me. It&#8217;s a shame, the way she could forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
her father in less than a month. She acts as if Dr.
Schubert were her own father. I don&#8217;t believe she has
shed a tear. No, I wouldn&#8217;t stop a day in Springdale
for that ungrateful girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your friends of a lifetime are here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make new friends in New York. Why
shouldn&#8217;t I? You think of me as an old woman, Larimore.
I don&#8217;t like it. The day has gone by when a
woman of fifty has to sit in the chimney-corner. I have
written to Ted, telling him that I want to buy back the old
home. You shall remodel it for me. That would be
a work you could take pride in&mdash;the house your great-grandfather
built.&#8221;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>When Lavinia and Judith were alone, the real
purpose of the former&#8217;s early morning call revealed itself:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me how far you can hold a person
to a promise&mdash;a voluntary promise, written on paper
and signed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends&mdash;&#8221; Judith eyed her narrowly&mdash;&#8220;on the
nature of the one who makes the promise. I wouldn&#8217;t
give a fig for all the contracts that ink and paper could
record, if there were no volition&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I am sure&mdash;that is, I think I have a right
to demand....&#8221; She swallowed hard and a hunted
look invaded the black eyes. &#8220;Would it be all right
for me to&mdash;to ask for some satisfaction, some decision?
You can&#8217;t let things go on in uncertainty. You have to
come to an understanding. I&mdash;that is, I don&#8217;t think my
brother has treated me right. Would you send the
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your own judgment, mother. You know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
a wretched failure I made of my former attempts to
advise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Judith, that was what I wanted to say to you.
I have thought it all out, and have come to the conclusion
that&mdash;that I had to do everything just as it came
about. Oh, I don&#8217;t know how to tell you&mdash;but I begin
to see how good comes out of evil&mdash;how I had to suffer
to gain my happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the door she turned, to ask, as if she were consulting
a sorceress: &#8220;Would you advise me to write the
letter&mdash;a very plain one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suspense is deadly. I should relieve my mind, at
any cost,&#8221; her daughter-in-law said dryly. It was
Lavinia Trench&#8217;s self-justification, the mind that could
mould the universe into a pedestal for the support of
her righteousness. It would be this way to the end.
Nothing would ever change her. David was dead, and
a letter of condolence had come from Calvin Stone, a
letter that all the world might read. In all likelihood
there had been no other word from him, since Lavinia
was free ... to make uncomfortable demands.</p>

<p>She went home and wrote. With her own hands she
carried the letter to the office, to insure delivery. It
had occurred to her to register it ... her feet tugging
to free themselves from the quicksand of doubt that
spread all around her. But Drusilla or Larimore might
take the receipt from the postman&#8217;s hand. Besides, it
would be a confession of the fear that was in her. She
must not act as if there were any question of her right,
in this matter. To Lavinia it was still &#8220;this matter.&#8221;
She did not name it, even to herself.</p>


<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Six tortured days she waited, and then the response<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
came. Theodora ran in terror to Judith, her black eyes
wide, her cheeks ashen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, precious? Don&#8217;t stand there shaking
like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my mamma, and she&#8217;s&mdash;I think she&#8217;s gone crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of something&mdash;a letter that came a few
minutes ago?&#8221; She had the child in her arms, soothing
her with gentle caresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sister Judith, what could my uncle write that
would make anyone as furious as that? Last night
she couldn&#8217;t sleep&mdash;because she said our whole life depended
on the letter she was looking for. She made me
come and get in bed with her, and she told me about
Bromfield till I fell asleep in her arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your uncle refused to let her have the old
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I was up on the third floor with
Drusilla, and all at once I knew that I was needed down
stairs. When I was half way down the hall&mdash;there
stood my mamma like a statue. She didn&#8217;t see me, any
more than if I&#8217;d been a spook without any body. And all
at once she began running back and forth and tearing the
letter to bits. And then she threw them on the floor and
stamped on them. She didn&#8217;t speak one single word.
That was the awful part&mdash;to be as mad as that, and take
it out in just jumping up and down!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here, dearie. Or, no&mdash;&#8221; after a moment&#8217;s
thought&mdash;&#8220;I want you to go and spend the day with
Eileen. Don&#8217;t tell her about the letter. Dutton can
drive you over in the car. You won&#8217;t need a hat.&#8221;</p>


<h4>V</h4>

<p>Judith surmised that Lavinia would not miss the child.
For an hour there was no sign of life in the big house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Then the widow emerged clad in all her weeds. From
the florist&#8217;s shop, at the corner, she returned with a great
cornucopia. It was evident that her destination was the
cemetery, and that she intended to walk. For Lavinia
Trench, on a steamy August day, such a walk was nothing
short of a penance.</p>

<p>Noon went by ... one, two o&#8217;clock ... and she
came staggering up the steps, and into the cool living-room
of Judith Trench&#8217;s home. Without a word she
sank into the nearest chair and drew aside the crêpe veil,
revealing a countenance from which every vestige of
youth had been erased. With the toe of her small shoe
she began to trace the winding pattern of the Oriental
rug, her lips set hard together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off your hat, mother. You don&#8217;t want that
hot veil around your neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll take it off. I don&#8217;t intend ever to wear the
thing again. If it isn&#8217;t in your heart&mdash;crêpe veils and
flowers on graves won&#8217;t put it there. Oh, my God in
heaven, why did David have to die&mdash;at such a time?
What right had he to die&mdash;and expose me to such an
insult?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had hurled the mourning hat from her, and sat
staring at her moist shaking hands. Then came the
reaction, a flood of colour, not scarlet but dull raspberry,
that spread over neck, cheek and brow. Stiffening in
her chair, she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you who did it, Judith Ascott, every bit of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did what?&#8221; Judith&#8217;s eyes blazed with sudden
anger. No, she would no longer palliate ... spare
this woman, who had always contrived to shift responsibility
to shoulders less blameworthy than her own, who
had taken the best she could snatch from life, giving not
even decent gratitude in return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>&#8220;You said that Sydney married Eileen and made her
happy, because she didn&#8217;t resist the temptation to do
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how monstrous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you aren&#8217;t going to deny that you told
me, point-blank, that nothing but a broken axle prevented
you from being untrue to your husband. Was it my fault
that the axle didn&#8217;t break for me?&#8221; She talked wildly,
her thin neck drawn and throbbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I blundered horribly when I said those things to you.
I thought you were a woman who could handle an
abstract idea. I didn&#8217;t know that everything I said must
necessarily have a personal application. If I had understood
why you were unhappy ... if you had told me
the truth, instead of leaving me to guess it, after the
mischief was done&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have told you&mdash;told such a thing to a
stranger ... when I never more than half admitted it
to myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am sure you couldn&#8217;t have told me. It is just
the awful fatality, that I should have put weapons into
your hand that would wound you&mdash;the very knives that
removed the false growth from Eileen&#8217;s spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and if the cancer is deep inside&mdash;if it grows out
of your heart ... the more you cut it away, the
stronger it grows. God knows, I tried to tear it out by
the roots. I tried three times to hate&mdash;&#8221;</p>


<h4>VI</h4>

<p>Judith drew near and laid a hand on the frantic
woman&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, it is the saddest case I have ever known. If
I assure you of my pity and my earnest wish to help you
... for Lary&#8217;s sake, and Theo&#8217;s,&#8221; Judith raised a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that checked the bitter outburst, &#8220;will you talk to me with
absolute frankness? You can&#8217;t bear this hideous thing
alone. You can&#8217;t take it to your daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sylvia! I would as soon put my hand in the fire, and
expect not to be burned. She would throw me out of her
house, as an abandoned woman. She is hard and selfish
and cruel. I don&#8217;t know where she gets such a nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t talk of Sylvia now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hope I&#8217;ll never see her again. And ...
Judith ... I am going to tell you ... from the beginning.
You know already&mdash;the worst of it. David
knew, the night before he died. That&#8217;s why I had to run
away, when I tried to lay the roses on his grave. It
made me wild with rage ... to know he was pitying
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rocked to and fro a moment, as if to settle the
sequence of her story. Then her eyes blazed with a
challenging light.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a cold woman. You can sit there and weigh
me ... like a pound of steak. You never knew what
it was to want something with your whole mind and body
and soul. You are not capable of a passion that would
burn you to a cinder. There are not many women with
as deep a nature as mine. It began when I was fourteen&mdash;a
plain little thing like Theo is, now. The night of
Edith Trench&#8217;s Hallowe&#8217;en party&mdash;and David begged
his sister to invite me. All the others were grown,
nearly. I happened to be standing in a dark corner,
under some mistletoe, and Calvin Stone tiptoed up behind
me and grabbed me in his arms and kissed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;That night I couldn&#8217;t sleep ... nor the next one.
Everything was changed. For two years, I used to
almost die when I saw him out with the older girls.
Then he went away to Buffalo, to business college, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
began to grow pretty. It&#8217;s a way we have in my father&#8217;s
family. When he came home, he fairly swept me off my
feet. If David had ever made love to me the way Calvin
did&mdash; The room would swim before my eyes when he
kissed me. He wanted me to marry him right away.
But in Bromfield that would have made a scandal. A
girl didn&#8217;t dare to seem too anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;After about a year he began to cool off. I waited
two years more, and then I married David. I may as
well tell you why. Calvin went to Rochester and
married that Fournier girl. She made him marry her.
Thank goodness, I was safe in Olive Hill before they let
it out that they were married. But the truth has leaked
out at last. It always does, no matter how smart you
think you are in concealing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped. This was not what she wanted to say&mdash;or
believe. A deep nausea overcame her. Eileen&#8217;s
secret ... her own! But no, she was making confession.
It would not go any further, if she told Judith
all ... to the last wicked detail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ellen thought all along that I married David for
spite; but she doesn&#8217;t know that I never got over loving
Calvin Stone. When I was first married I used to lie
awake nights, thinking of the time when David and Lettie
would both be dead, and I could have the man I wanted.
I forced David to make good, so that I could taunt Calvin.
After he moved back to Bromfield&mdash;when his father
broke down, and he had to take charge of the bank&mdash;Ellen
and Lettie were friends. That way, I learned a
good deal about them. I saved all her letters that
mentioned Calvin. The others I put in the fire, as soon
as David had read them. The bundle I want buried with
me. It was reading them over and over that made me
the woman I am now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>&#8220;Mother, can&#8217;t you go home and burn them&mdash;blot this
hateful thing from your mind&mdash;now when your heart is
soft because of father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David Trench! He doesn&#8217;t count, one way or the
other. David was never anything but a makeshift in my
life. If he had abused me, instead of giving me all that
affection, it wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad. I didn&#8217;t want
his love, and I despised him because he could go on loving
me ... the way I treated him. I hated my children,
because he was their father. After they came, I loved
them for what I could see of myself in them. Isabel was
so like her father that it was comical&mdash;and I could hardly
bear to touch her. Judith, think of being a wife for
almost thirty years to a man you hated! You couldn&#8217;t
have gone through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I would have run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I hadn&#8217;t any place to run to. I was caught, like
a hungry rat in a trap. I could look out through the bars
and see all the things I wanted, beyond my reach. When
I did drag something inside, it turned out to be different
from what I expected. When we celebrated our silver
wedding, the minister told how we were the ideal couple,
that God had joined together in our cradles. It was the
vilest mockery. But David was so proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you never saw his worth&mdash;never responded to
his tenderness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until I came home from Bromfield, two years
ago. That was the only time David and I came together,
in all those years. I never knew how handsome he was
until I had been looking at Calvin every day for a month.
And his appearance wasn&#8217;t all of it. I had made up my
mind, while I was still at Ellen&#8217;s, that I was going to treat
David different. You couldn&#8217;t help seeing that I had all
the best of the bargain. The house Calvin built, ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
years ago, is no comparison to mine. And he had to
mortgage it to the limit, when his son got into trouble.
Lately he sold it, to keep from losing it outright. That
was when I wrote him that I would buy back the old house
from my brother. But that&#8217;s ... I&#8217;ll come to that,
later on. All those years I had been thinking of David
as a poor carpenter, and Calvin as a banker, in fine
society. And when I found out that he didn&#8217;t have near
as much as I had&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see how you found your deep satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t. It wasn&#8217;t just the money, and
David&#8217;s position in Springdale&mdash;on the Board of
Trustees, and all that. I got my real triumph after I
started for home. I had snubbed Calvin and tormented
him in every way I could. I wasn&#8217;t going to let him think
I went to Bromfield on his account. Besides, I wanted
to hurt him, for the way he had treated me. I thought
I would take it out on him, and that would end it. If I
had been trying to win him, I couldn&#8217;t have used better
tactics.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on the train and we were pulling out of
Rochester when he came walking in the Pullman. At
first he pretended to be surprised. Said he was going to
Buffalo on business. After a while he owned up that he
had come ... because he wanted to be alone with me.
He told me that his life had been hell on earth, and he
was glad when Lettie died. He even said that if David
should die, he would go to the end of the world to compel
me to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lavinia ignored the comment. Hot lava was pouring
from the crater of her wretchedness, lava long pent up,
and such flimsy obstacles as her daughter-in-law&#8217;s disgust
were swept away unnoticed in its stream.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>&#8220;I told him he wasn&#8217;t fit for David Trench to wipe his
feet on. I didn&#8217;t mean it ... but I talk that way when
I am beside myself. When I repulsed David, he would
look hurt and walk away. But it only made Calvin more
determined. He said he would lie down and let me wipe
my feet on him. And then he said something sneering
about &#8216;Dave Trench.&#8217; I flew into a rage&mdash;and he said I
always was a beauty when I was angry. Afterwards he
almost cried when he begged me to show some little spark
of affection for him. He was always that way ...
wanted what he thought he couldn&#8217;t get. I see the whole
thing now, as plain as day. It is easy to see things, when
it&#8217;s too late. If the minister hadn&#8217;t preached that sermon
about helping to redeem sinners by making them
suffer, and you hadn&#8217;t told me all that other ... about
it being worse to want to sin than to come right out and
do the thing you wanted....&#8221;</p>

<p>Judith shifted uneasily in her chair. Her own indictment
was surely on the way. She had no choice but to
see the play through, to the final curtain.</p>

<p>&#8220;He began writing to me, on one pretext or another.
I didn&#8217;t answer more than half of his letters. And the
meaner I treated him, the more devoted he grew. All
that time I was falling in love with David&mdash;and I didn&#8217;t
hesitate to tell Calvin so. It seemed to make him wild.
The very day I found out about Eileen, I had had a
letter from him that I was ashamed to read, in my own
room. I believe that letter would have finished him for
me ... if it hadn&#8217;t been for Eileen.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he heard about Larimore&#8217;s marriage, he wrote
again&mdash;and asked me to forgive him for writing the
other letter. But he said his love for me drove him to
it. And at the same time, David was acting like a
paralytic old woman&mdash;just crushed by what Eileen had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
done. I couldn&#8217;t help seeing the difference. I knew
what Calvin would have done, if he had had a daughter
act that way. He would have put his son in jail, if it
hadn&#8217;t been for Lettie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needed a masterful man. David was too
gentle....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never was any match for me ... in any way.
If I hadn&#8217;t snapped him up, the night after Mr. Stone told
me that Calvin was married....&#8221; She shook herself,
as if to free her body from some insidious lethargy that
was creeping over her.</p>

<p>&#8220;While you and Larimore were in Europe, it got to be
like a continued story in a magazine. I kept wondering
what would happen next. I had cut loose from David,
and I couldn&#8217;t keep my mind off of Calvin. After you
came home with Eileen, and I had the long talk with you,
the story took a different turn. Still ... I don&#8217;t believe
anything would have come of it if Calvin hadn&#8217;t had
to take a business trip to Chicago. He wrote, in a kind
of joking way, that if I would run up there and spend a
few days with him, David would divorce me and we
could be married at once. That was last April. I wrote
back that I wouldn&#8217;t think of such a thing&mdash;and that men
didn&#8217;t marry the women who forgot their morals&mdash;except
at the point of a gun. He answered, with a kind of
marriage compact&mdash;no matter what might come up&mdash;he
would marry me as soon as I was free. He had to go to
Chicago again in July. I told him I would see him in
Sylvia&#8217;s home, on his way out, and we could talk things
over, and come to an understanding. It was all Larimore&#8217;s
fault that the whole thing turned out wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How Lary&#8217;s fault?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know he wouldn&#8217;t let me start in time to catch
Calvin in Detroit. Then I planned to go by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Chicago, and see him between trains. But Larimore
insisted on getting the ticket direct. There was only one
thing for me to do. I wired Calvin, and sent a special
letter to Sylvia, saying I wouldn&#8217;t be in Detroit until
Tuesday noon. I planned to get into Chicago early
Monday morning, and go back to Detroit that night.
I wrote the letter to David while I was waiting at the
station, Sunday afternoon. The rest of it&mdash;after Calvin
met me&mdash;is like a dream, a miserable dream. So much
has happened since then.</p>

<p>&#8220;That evening he made me miss my train. After I
had been with him a while, I was limp as a rag in his
hands. He always had that way with women. I didn&#8217;t
want to go. All the years of my misery had dissolved.
I was like a starved person at a banquet ... seventeen
again, and Calvin acting like a boy out of school. But
the second day he began to change. He told me to quit
acting like an old fool&mdash;said it wasn&#8217;t becoming in people
of our age. If David had ever said anything like that
to me&mdash;&#8221; Her hands worked convulsively and the teeth
gave forth a sharp, gritting sound. &#8220;I tried to be the
way Calvin wanted me, and everything I did was wrong.
Once I flared up, and he told me to cut that out&mdash;that it
was because of my vile temper that he didn&#8217;t marry me
thirty years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are going to discipline yourself, mother, so
that after your year of mourning you can marry him and
be happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry him!&#8221; A shrill laugh burst from Lavinia&#8217;s
lips. &#8220;Marry him! He was married last Saturday to a
rich widow in Rochester. That isn&#8217;t the worst of it. I
had written him the plainest kind of letter&mdash;about the
house we would remodel&mdash;and the contract he had sent
me in April. They read it together. They are laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
at me now. God, I can&#8217;t stand it! To have them gloat
over me! I could tear my heart out and stamp on it. I
could curse. I could spit in the face of the God that
made me. Why did you advise me to write the letter?
It was you&mdash;you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She had leaped from her chair, her face livid, her arms
writhing. Judith tried to speak. Her tongue was
paralysed. She had looked into the soul of the woman
who bore Larimore Trench, and the sight turned her sick
with horror. Then a piercing scream, a startled cry,
another scream, and Lavinia crumpled down in her chair,
clasping her hands to her right side, shrieking and moaning
by turns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, what has happened to you? Let me send
for a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t leave me!&#8221; A long wail of anguish
indescribable&mdash;and she put forth a restraining hand.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what has happened to me? Can&#8217;t you
see that I am dying? Dr. Schubert told me two years
ago that there was danger. I didn&#8217;t believe him....&#8221;</p>

<p>She choked back another cry of pain, cringing until
her right cheek almost touched her knee. Then she
straightened herself and went on, through set teeth:</p>

<p>&#8220;You will take Theo, Judith, and keep her for your
own? I wouldn&#8217;t want Sylvia to have her. You won&#8217;t
let her&mdash;miss the path?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will give her the best I have, mother. I know what
you mean.&#8221; She stopped speaking, fascinated by the
tinge of green that crept slowly up the stricken woman&#8217;s
cheeks. The same dull green was advancing along the
arms, where the black sleeves were drawn up. Lavinia
saw it, too. She knew the portent. Once before, she
had seen that wave of green that moved with deadly
precision beneath the skin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the gall. It has burst. My grandmother died
that way. She flew into a rage&mdash;after the doctor warned
her not to. I taste it, now ... bitter ... in my
throat....&#8221; She coughed spasmodically, and closed
her eyes.</p>


<h4>VII</h4>

<p>Judith ran to the telephone. She told Lary that his
mother had fainted. To Eileen she said bluntly:
&#8220;Mother is dying. Send one of the doctors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eileen called a dozen numbers before she located either
Sydney or his father. Then she left her little sister in
Nanny&#8217;s care and hurried to Vine Cottage.</p>

<p>When the old family physician reached the house,
Lavinia Trench had passed beyond human aid. He drew
Judith into the breakfast room and asked, unsteadily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there a violent outburst? Grief wouldn&#8217;t
account for it ... nor remorse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman nodded, her throat swelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Lary. He need not know. He wouldn&#8217;t
understand. Women are so different, Dr. Schubert. I
wouldn&#8217;t want Lary to despise his mother. She wasn&#8217;t
wholly to blame&mdash;that the frost came too late.&#8221;</p>

other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
